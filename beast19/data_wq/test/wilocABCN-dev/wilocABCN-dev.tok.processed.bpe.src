it &apos;s difficult answer at the question &quot; what are you going to do in the future ? &quot; if the only one who has to know it is in two minds .
when I was younger I used to say that I wanted to be a teacher , a sales@@ woman and even a but@@ cher .. I do n&apos;t know why .
I would like to study Psychology because one day I would open my own psychology office and help people .
it &apos;s difficult because I &apos;ll have to study hard and a lot , but I think that if you like a subject , you &apos;ll study it easier .
maybe I &apos;ll change my mind , maybe not .
I think that the public transport will always be in the future .
the rich people will buy a car but the poor people always need to use a bus or taxi .
I consider that is more convenient to drive a car because you carry on more things in your own car than travelling by car .
also , you &apos;ll meet friendly people who usually ask to you something to be friends and change your telephone number .
in my experience when I did n&apos;t have a car I used to use the bus to go to the school and go back to my house .
in my opinion , the car is n&apos;t necessary when you have crashed in the street , in that moment you realized the importance of a public transport .
in India we have various types of Public transport , like C@@ ycle , Bi@@ ke , Car , Train &amp; F@@ light .
depending on the distance and duration to the desired place , mode of transport is chosen accordingly .
but Gener@@ ally speaking , travelling by car is much more fun when compared with other modes of transport .
this reminds me of a trip that I have recently been to and the place is A@@ gr@@ a .
it takes around 6 hours by National highway to go from Delhi to A@@ gr@@ a .
we have stopped at hotels for having food and just in case if any of us feels hungry , we have purchased some snacks just before the trip .
since , we have the option to wait anytime we want to when we travel by car ( which is impossible when travelling by train &amp; F@@ light ) .
in addition to it , we can also take a comfortable short nap on the back seat and wake up fresh .
due to the above mentioned reasons , I am going to conclude that travelling by car is much more convenient .
my name is Sarah .
I am 17 years old .
I am looking forward to join you in this year summer camps .

in addition to that , I enjoy cooking .
my family think that my cook is amazing .

my favourite sport is volleyball because I love plays with my friends .
volleyball is a sport play every place , when I travel on the beach I like plays with my sister in the sand and after we are going to the sea .
it is very funny .
when I was young I like plays with the ball in the playground and my friend and I played using the soccer goals as a network of volleyball .
dear Jo ,
how are you ? I &apos;m writing to inform you that some advice on travelling and working in my country .
on the one hand , in my country there are a lot of place to travel .
for example Barcelona , Madrid , Sevilla , Valencia .
there are wonderful cities because there are a lot of things to visit for example in Madrid you can visit &quot; Puer@@ ta del So@@ l &quot; , &quot; Las Ci@@ be@@ les &quot; .
I visit Madrid twice a year .
all summer I visit Sevilla because I love this city and I suggest that you visit Sevilla .
on the other hand , in my country there are a few job because the economy is very bad .
but , if you want I look for a job from you .
my best friend looking for a people responsible for look after her sister .
her sister is 6 years old and you should look after every weekend .
you will be interesting in this job ?
thank you for you e - mail , it was wonderful to hear from you .
I &apos;m looking forward to seeing you .
take care , Laura .
today public transport still play an important role in transport system and it will keep on in the future .
because public transport is a cost effective and better resource allocation in mass transport system .
also people need not to suffer high operating cost running their own car .
but it can use a cheaper way going to their destination especially it is far away from home .
for example , I think that it is not affordable for an ordinary person to own a private airplane travelling to another country .
instead it will be common to buy an air ticket and ride on public plane .
in my opinion I think that public transport in future is going to continue to be used because there are a lot of people that does n&apos;t have enough money to pay for a car even if it is used , so public transport continue to have future but people are going to use more the cars then bus or underground .
if we think about it the car is better because we do n&apos;t need to wait for them has we are waiting for the bus or underground but in another way car cost more money than the public transport .
by car we can just stay with ourselves which can be good because we can listen to the music that we like and we do n&apos;t need to be around people that are un@@ wounded but if we chose public transport we can meet friends or family so both transportation are good and the cars do n&apos;t need necessarily to end up with the public transport .
if I had it to choose between both transportation I think I probably chose car because it is better for me to go by car then to go by bus .
in my community , we are very interested at environment and ecological things .
we have solar panels and a place to make compost at the last garden , with worms who eat and de@@ grade all the organic waste of the school .
in some strategic points of the building we have special trash cans to separate the garbage in organic , paper and cardboard , cans and pet bottles and they also made talks and presentations about the earth problems like global warming , contamination , etc .
the manager of all this project is Miss June S@@ id , our science teacher .
all this initiatives has made us all over the years a recognised ecological community .
good morning everyone , today I want to share about is my favorite sport .
my favorite sport is football , why I choose it ? well , football is a international sport , people around the world will love it so much ! example like Bar@@ clay Premier League , L@@ iga Premier , FIFA World Cup and so on .
I believe that &apos;s all will delighted us .
by the way , my favorite football team is Manchester United , they are brilliant , they have an amazing football players , and they are awesome .
Michael was a little kid when he had a dream that was : be a super hero !
after many years he still dream to become a super hero .
he enter the university of medicine because he thinks that this profession was the more similar to be a super hero .
pass some years of the university and he know a girl called Kate and he get loved on here and she get loved in him .
Kate was cur@@ sing the university of fashion .
then the two started to date .
Michael and Kate was so happy , until one day that Michael said to him dream to be a super hero , Kate get so nervous saying that it was ridiculous and just a kid dream and that Michael was only dreaming but that would never happen and that super hero do n&apos;t exist .
when she said that , Michael started to cry and get mad saying that she was lying and do n&apos;t have heart .
he got so mad that he asked her to get out of his apartment .
in following day , she said sorry and them was happy again .
but when them get to the home of Michael they fight again and Michael get a knife and kill her .
he cried with a lot blood around .
Michael get away from there .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
public transportation is an important invention in human history , it brings amount of benefits in our life .
for instance , we take subway in order to avoid stoc@@ king in traffic .
it is true that moving by car is more convenient than take public transportation , however , it would cause more damage to our life and harm our environment .
therefore , we need to think more about our future , our off@@ springs .
giving them a safe , clean and comfortable place to live .
if there is no public transportation , traffic jam will be serious than before .
in my country , Taipei , we always stock in traffic for about one hour in the morning .
I can not imagine if there is no bus or MRT , how long I will take for school .
car is convenient for human , but it brings damage for human also .
for example , carbon dioxide which is created by car .
it cause global warming which threats our environment and harms our daily life .
we can see that there are lots of serious and frequently weather disaster happened in decades , such as typhoon , hurricane , wild fire and mud slide .
what other precautions , is usually taken ?
the N@@ G Office is notified by the photographer when the film was shipped .
if the film does n&apos;t arrive on time , it immediately .
lost ship@@ ments have been found more easily when this process will be started right away
the pleasure of traveling
people go , people come .
every day lots of people are travelling abroad but , what &apos;s the best way to do an international travel ?
the most important option to travel is , by far , the plane .
but , even when it &apos;s true that it &apos;s the faster option , you must be very careful at time to get off a plane .
if you are looking for comfort and relax , obviously , you have to take a boat .
there are a wide variety of things to do and enjoy the trip .
although , the better option , is pick out a train .
there is n&apos;t comparative on watching the changes in the landscape through a window , enjoying the way that you are doing and , the best part , the cheapest way to get away some days and take the routine off some days .
anyway , no matter how you go , no matter where you go .
the pleasure of travelling is travel at all .
transportation one of the most important thing on life so we have many of kinds for transportation now we travel by car but in the near future it will be other comfort and easy ways to travel like fast train and plane that can transport you from north to south in less than hour this will make business men happy and comfort because of saving a lot of times and efforts so we hope that the government can achieve this way as soon as possible
in modern societies , there are lots of friends around our daily lives .
big project could not be finished without co - operations .
friends could be communicated and exchanged the ideas , feelings and funny things happened around ourselves .
more importantly , the parents give our lives and they touch us knowledge and skills or abilities to live in this world .
in this case , the families played important roles in daily lives .
the reasons are as follows .
first of all , we could learn lots of skills from parents according to their own experience .
for example , we could learn how to communicate with others in a friendly way , and we could also learn how to make a meal from parents .
secondly , the families could give you some advice about how to deal with the things which will cause trouble .
if difficulties was told to the families , the ideas would come up to your families and communicate with you about how to solve this situation .
all in all , in this case , the families are the most important friends in our lives .
the Compu@@ ting Technology has been advancing very much this last years , making the old computers almost useless , getting better and making the difference between old and new computers grow even more with every new discover@@ ers .
as we can notice , old and new computers are vastly different , starting from the size of the computers , old computers were much bigger than new computers .
old computers were used to occupy one entire room , now , they only have the size of a box , even the size of a book .
you can have a portable computer now , and take it with you to every place you visit .
old computers only let you make math tasks , or even play simple games with 2 colors ( green and black ) , but now you can do whatever you want to do , like creating or playing videogames , writing or reading a book , connect to the internet , watch or make videos , invent new stuff to improve the Compu@@ ting Technology , and not only in 2 colors , but thousand of them .
one of the greatest achievements of new computing , is the internet , where you can connect to other computers , download stuff , etc . via E@@ ther@@ net cable or Wi@@ re@@ less Con@@ ne@@ ction ( Wi - Fi ) .
get rest M@@ 8
I went to the abandon house and started to think the best way to make his life miserable I passed the next 2 weeks looking for ideas to make him suffer .
as I did n&apos;t found nothing , I went to the place he live at and started to look for some information about his life and found people who he care about so as I continued to go to his house I notice he will always go to the same house so I decided to follow him to the house and I found out he was dating a girl she might be his girlfriend so I finally got an idea , I would drive him crazy just as he did with me , that way she will think he had problems on his mind and left him , but son I thought about it again and realized that if I did that she will try to help him and they will be more united , so I decided to drive them both crazy almost at the border of death , j@@ us as he did with me !
but wait a minute am I really so angry to make this ?
yes !
I screamed , my anger had dominated my mind I did nt had no longer control over my actions , I was afraid of what I had become and what I could do , but I could not control my self and the only thing I could think of was him suffering with a slow death and the satisfaction I would feel when I finally had my revenge , the best revenge .
but I was so mad at him and so man@@ si@@ o to make his life impossible , and soon my fear of death and my anger for all of the suffering I had been through became stronger and bigger , I had made a deposition I was going to do it , if he dedicated 4 years of his life tor@@ turing me and not wanting me to be happy I would the time is necessary for him to have a miserable life and I wo nt stop until I had accomplished my goal
I &apos;m not agree with this idea completely .
on the one hand travel by car are really much more convenient as give the chance to you to be independent .
on the other hand huge traffic jams are a big issue for travelling by car .
my Favourite sport
I born to be a football player .

public transportation has been more used by people and over the years it is kind of becoming cheaper and also more safe but some people prefer cars to extent do we agree with and what is our reasons for that that is what are we going to demonstrate in this essay
before about 40 years there was nothing called public transportation and people rarely owned cars so in those years there was not even good facility to move from place to other and that is because there was no companies to build cars in about 10 years cars trading became viable and also became very supported by having her own fans at the beginning the faced a lot of problems but they were able to solve it by the end
nowadays all facilities of travelling are more convenient from cars to buses even trains and planes . some people prefer cars because the do like crowded places or because the find it sometimes cheaper but from another point of view public transportation is very cheap and even faster but when it comes to traveling a lot of people prefer riding their own cars to feel the real experience and to enjoy more by chilling out from crowded places
to summ@@ aries it is different from some ones opinion to another I predict that public transportation will be improved and people will use it more and more that by the end cars will disappear and will will no longer be used
the topic itself explaining the uncertainty of public transport in our country .
this conclusion become more prominent if we look into the data of the car companies and expon@@ ential growth in their sales figure and with low budget private cars in picture , scenario dramatically changed in past 10 years
development of bio@@ diesel industry can be a contribution to productivity growth .
a large scale of investment was bring for bio@@ fuel development .
meanwhile , it boost economic growth and jobs opportunity , thereby enhance Gross Domestic Product ( GDP ) .
if you are living in big town or small It does matter but one thing should be taking care by the people and organiser of the town , is environment .
global warming is huge issue in today &apos;s date .
government should take immense action to stop it or at least make it slow down .
however we the people have really important part of making it worse .
active and a good government understand the value of taking care of trees and water and air and much more to provide a fresh , clean and safe environment to their people .
recycling item can be a good step to start with clean and safe environment which is perfectly and promptly taking care by my city .
everyone have to plant a tree in front of their home with the rule of province government .
people is not realizing that cutting the tree can reduce the production of oxygen in atmosphere .
eventually human will have no more fresh air to breath .
additionally , our city government has prohibited smoking in public area and under 18 year old and provides a free session of talk or presentation to increase the awareness of clean , safe , fresh environment to the city .
in conclusion , I would suggest to our neighbour cities to taking part of cleaning environment so one day it can be seen in whole country .
everybody has his favourite sport .
my favourite sport is football game .
on our school or village football stadium I spend a lot of time every day .
usually I play football with my classmates .
before training I ran 1 - 2 kilometres and my legs get a power and my body gets an energy .
our team has a hard - working coach and he gives professional advice to us , how to improve football skills .
his main words : &quot; you must work and work very hard , if you want to get high results &quot; .
I can say , that coach is experienced person .
not so long ago , we are had competition .
the first place was getting by us .
we have achieved this result , because we are friendly and organised .
I believe , that in the future I will be a famous football player in teams such as Sk@@ ha@@ tar or Dy@@ nam@@ o .
football is my life .
I want to give advice to someone who starts this sport : &quot; you must believe in yourself &quot; .
Hallo my friend ,
what &apos;s up ?
how are you ?
how was your day today ?
it &apos;s really nice for your expres@@ s@@ ly e - mail yesterday .
you regret that you were n&apos;t there with me . I &apos;ll try cri@@ bbed everything precisely , because I know that you very
dear Paul ,
I have seen your notice in the academy newspaper and I &apos;m quite interested . I have no plans for this summer so I think it is a good idea to spend it .
I was born in the UK so I can be a very good teacher of English .
although I came to Spain ten years later so I can speak with them in Spanish if it was necessary .
also , I assisted to a ballet course for 4 years when I was young .
it was a lot of time ago , however , I still keep the rhythm in my body !
by the way , I remember I had to create a dynamic training to do with the other ballet - course members . I had to be the teacher for one day and I did n&apos;t forget it because I felt wonderful .
all members congratulated me , as well .
on the other hand , I had taken care of my brothers and cousins for many hours when they were very young .
you must know that I &apos;m a very responsible , kind and funny person .
that makes me a good candidate to achieve the job , or the hobby for me !
I hope you keep in mind my candid@@ ature because I &apos;m not going to disappoint you .
best wishes , Julia .
in my opinion public transport wo n&apos;t be suffered by the shortage in demand .
because not everyone afford to buy their own car .
besides there are lots of low income people who ca n&apos;t buy their own car .
so I think public transport &apos;s future is bright .
what is the &quot; Family &quot; meaning ?
in my opinion , Family is the place that had you best friend can help each other and know each .
in the Taiwan , many of people have to take care of them parent when they get old , but the point is what if you can not survival , I mean you do n&apos;t have enough money to raise you parent .
back to the topic , I do n&apos;t know well any of member of in my family , I do n&apos;t trust them , honestly .
I like New@@ Zealand because there are many islands .
by the way , New@@ Zealand have a cool weather .
in Malaysia , the weather is slightly warmer than there .
that &apos;s why I order all of you to go there and feel the pleasure and have a try their own food .
you can also bought a lot of gifts like key chains , statue , or what else memories to be made before returning to Malaysia .
I did not have to go to New@@ Zealand but believe me it is very beautiful place .
if I have sust@@ en@@ ance , I will go there and bring all of you .
I live in L@@ ent@@ ini , a small city in East Sicily .
the local Council has n&apos;t a project for the environment .
people collect any kind of rubbish and throws all together in black sack .
although the Council began to plan something , the people are n&apos;t committed with the problem .
around the city , you can find many places where the people throw fri@@ go , kitchen , &quot; ami@@ an@@ to &quot; , old things or furniture .
what a pity !
the suburbs of L@@ ent@@ ini could be wonderful .
there are orange trees , a large lake and E@@ t@@ na in background .
when I was a child , I had a lot friends and they were very important for me .
we ever played in the park or we talked about our tastes , music , boys , we laugh a lot of ...
but when I was a teenager I began to live situations that I did not like it , for instance , the girls said to me bad things or they talked bad about me .
in those years I lived the worst moments in my life .
I remember when I celebrated my 15th birthday , only one school@@ mate wanted to come to my party ; I think that this day was one of the worst day of my life .
there night I cried because I felt that I have not got any friends .
however , my parents tried that my party was the best and they prepared for me a special birthday and they invited all my cousins and together went to eat pizza and gave me a lot of presents .
in there moment , I thought that my best friends was my parents and sister .
I knew that they never talk bad about me .
now , my husband is my best friend .
he is the most important people of my life .
he has ever been with me .
also , he is very funny and I laugh a lot with him .
both like to travel around the world and to practise some sports , for example , tennis , running or trekking .
we like watching TV series and cooking several desserts too .
to sum up , my best friends are my family , especially , David , my husband .
life of people around the globe is becoming busier and busier day by day .
a busy life always compels to use the fastest and most convenient mode of transportation , which has made public transportation system lag behind motor cars .

the technology have bran@@ ched the people &apos;s life very much . in fact we can think how different is our life respect either to our parents or our grandparents life . for example my parents did n&apos;t wh@@ ac@@ th on TV , because there was n&apos;t any TV on the world when they were young . but it is n&apos;t the alone difference : we can think at the mobi@@ lef@@ one , the computer ed at least the internet . our grandparents wound n&apos;t imagine a strange machine like computer in their life .
although the fact that personal vehicle like car now is popular , in the future , the stance of public transport is still very crucial .
now@@ aday , people use fossil fuel as the most important source of energy for travelling , manufacturing , this source of energy does n&apos;t always maintain at the constant level , but someday it will be run out .
people must find ways to use other energy sources like nuclear electricity , wind power , public transportation such as electric metro use this kind of energy .
as a result , governments will invest more in researching the usage of these new types of energy , travelling using public transport will become much cheaper than personal car .
the range of public services will be expanded to remote areas , it become much more convenient .
commuting , travelling using public services will be the first prior choice .
in addition , the population is increasing rapidly , in the near future , almost cities in the world will become overcrowded , It will lead to many other problems to be solved , for example , traffic jams , air pollution .
in some perspectives , these problems are led by the over - using of personal vehicle .
people will realise that using their own car is just to waste their time for traffic jams or to gradually killing themselves for breathing polluted air .
so the best way for them to travel is public transportation .
each person should practice saving when using any source of enemy to protect his own live .
in conclusion , investments on developing public transport will be increased considerably , public services of travelling have a bright potential and it &apos;s stance in the future ca n&apos;t be replaced
Hello Alex , how are you .
are you free for weekend , have you any plans .
me and my friends go to the cinema , and I invite you to go with us .
if you are interested , find me at 8 clock near the cinema entrance .
thank you Helen for those wonderful presents .
I always want to read these type of book .
I went to temple in the morning followed by lunch at the hotel latter in the evening went to the beach .
in conclusion it is evident that because developing countries are facing political and economic instability , migrants travel for better education prospects and stable environment for younger generation to grow up .
the effects of brain drain are that it creates a shortage of people qualified for professional jobs , economic stability is affected as a result of lack of people contributing to the economy .
the cause of Brain - drain should be tack@@ led at international and national level on a broader dimensions and rational pattern , for it is a global issue .
in this situation , developing nations should take control of inflation ; focus on boosting up the infrastructure and law enforcement to support public in a positive manner .
there is n&apos;t too few oxygen at the top of Ever@@ est to breathe easily
Jordan Rom@@ ero has got 13 when he climbed Ever@@ est in May 2010 .
Mount Ever@@ est is so high that it is very difficult to climb .
the top was reached for the first time by two climbers in 195@@ 3 .
my friends and I , we like a programs of TV , electronic music , fashionable clothes . I prefer all .
sometimes we are going to the party &apos;s in the city , I am dancing in the party with my friends .
they listen to the music and can we are singing .
it &apos;s very good .
Jason is my friend , he is drunk and also he dance with your girlfriend .
Jose is the best song . he is singing and talking in the party .
other person is Angel , he do n&apos;t dance in all place .
he prefer study in your home .
Hello Something .
my names is Steven and I &apos;m 14 years old . I &apos;m living in German .
in the moment I visit the Secondary modern school .
I &apos;m in grade 8 .
my life is difficult because I have to realize everything .
for example there are girl she is in my class she is beautiful .
I love her look .
her eyes looks as the sun .
but she is ignored me .
I hope I can forget her .
run for your life
my favourite sport is run .
I like to running fast so fast in fact that it feel me as if I run on air and the feet do not hardly touch the ground between the strides .
my favourite place to run is in the forest but I like to run spor@@ tive too .
I am liking to feel the ground under my feet is soft so soft not the hard concrete of the foot@@ paths in the city of the streets .
the be@@ sted advice I can giving to someone who is starting the running is to starting slowly and not to try to run too fast but then to eventually build up the running week by week so that every week you are running a little more further and a little more faster and then after 20 years you will be an Olympic champion maybe .
in my opinion , television can be educational . whether you are watching the news or a show about World War One .
of course , it &apos;s important to choose the right television shows .
if you &apos;re watching Tom &amp; Jerry , it hardly will have any educational value .
although one could argue that you can always learn something .
a friend of mine recently explained that if a zombie ap@@ ok@@ aly@@ sp@@ e should happen he would be prepared because he has been watching Walking Dead for some time now - so in his eyes , he learned how ( not ) to act in that case .
today I want to write about my job .
I &apos;m a for@@ ens@@ ic biologist and I deeply love my job .
it is a job with a lot of interesting aspects ,
it is dynamic , stimulating and , even if it is not well rem@@ un@@ er@@ ated , I feel myself satisfied .
in the last few years for@@ ens@@ ic biology has developed many aspects like better sen@@ sibility , ro@@ bu@@ st@@ ness of results and less time required for analyze a sample , but what struck me most is how fast this change happens .
television seems to be a controversial tool .
here there is one : do television offer highly likely opportunities for the audience in an educational way ?
from my experience knowledge , I believe television cover both entertaining and educational functions .
it notes how many educational programmes broaden young children &apos;s horizons in the past few years , how quickly an adult learn different basics from a great deal number of educational programmes , such as cooking , science and technology .
it also notes educational programmes make a decision on what citizens should know in the future and what knowledge our next generations are required to possess .
apart from educational contents , there are so many f@@ oul contents , business advertisements and fake information on TV that citizens wo n&apos;t be able to tell right from wrong .
however , I believe the educational programmes on TV still plays a vital role in educating both adults and young children .
I think who the best restaurant where we can go is &quot; the sailor &apos;s restaurant &quot;
here we can eat typical Italian food .
the last time who I was here I have eat the best pizza that I have ever eat in my life .
the atmosphere remind the theme of the sea in fact the walls are decorating with a lot of shell and the waiters are dressed like sailors : I think that it &apos;s a great idea !
also , It &apos;s perfect for our class because there is a lot of space so we can sit all together at the same table .
the owner is a very kind person and I &apos;m sure who he makes us a convenience price .
no future for public transport ?
public transport is the cheaper way of travel , so it has future .
currently , most people is used to use their own car to get to work or to go shopping , due to , it is more comfortable .
but cars pollute the air with CO2 emissions every day and contribute to the climate change .
so , if people were aware of this subject would n&apos;t use so much their own car .
in addition , having a car is very expensive .
first of all you need can afford to buy it , after that , you must pay for the insurance , council tax , and mechanic bills , and so on .
whereas in a public transport , you only have to pay the ticket , you do n&apos;t have to drive and if the bus or train or whatever vehicle you use , breaks down it is n&apos;t your responsibility .
besides , public transport pollute less than cars .
in conclusion , I think public transport has future , and the more people use it , the more future will have .
I &apos;m your employee , to serve on your company .
very pleased to be able to receive your salary payment .
but pay a little low .
I completed many tasks , including tutoring three students complete summer homework , correcting homework diligently assist the instructor , the instructor helped organize hand@@ outs , instead of the instructor to answer questions raised by the students , but also to clean the classroom hygiene , very hard , but I have nothing to complain about .
I work hard for two months , pay a lot .
just your wage paid too much lower than I expected , I want a little higher wages , payment of 300 yuan more than the existing wage basis .
I invite you to consider the proposal .
I think about transport that the government has to help the public transport , for example bus , train , metro and more , for the only one reason : the quality of life against the pollution .
travelling by car is more convenient in a lot of situation , but it could be annoying for search parking and for cost of fuel , and also maintenance cost .
in big cities public transport works well because there &apos;s a good feedback by people .
instead in the small cities , it ca n&apos;t be good in the same way , because for the transport companies it &apos;s not convenient invest money , because fewer people would use it .
Tom S@@ aw@@ yer was a boy that lived with his aunt Pol@@ ly and she had to punish Tom because sometimes Tom did n&apos;t go to school .
on Monday Tom went walking to school and he saw his friend H@@ uck which they talk a lot and Tom exchanged a tick for his tooth .
then he saw a beautiful girl named Bec@@ ky so Tom talk to her at school and they went into a secret garden and Tom kissed Bec@@ ky .
Tom say to her of another girl so she got mad and she ignored Tom .
Tom was so sad because Bec@@ ky did n&apos;t to talk with him so Tom went on a trip with H@@ uck and disappeared for weeks .
when Tom saw his house he sne@@ ak into his house and saw he aunt Pol@@ ly crying for him .
so the next day the people of the town went to church to hear the funeral of Tom because many people thought that Tom was dead but suddenly Tom open the door and got in so everybody was so surprised to see Tom .
the next day H@@ uck went to Tom &apos;s house to tell him that there is an abandoned house up the hill so the two boys considered like an adventure .
so they went to the mysterious house and when they were inside they heard voices so Tom and H@@ uck hide and they saw that In@@ ju@@ in Joe was the one that was talking .
the two boys heard that he was planing to steal some money and kill people so the boys start their adventure on stopping In@@ ju@@ in Joe ...
Hi , Jo .
thank you for your message .
I will do my best to answer your questions .
as for your questions , I think that you should work in Japanese restaurant , such as Japanese &quot; ry@@ ote@@ i &quot; and &quot; kay@@ ak &quot; .
that is because you will improve your Japanese skill in them .
recently , many south East Asians have studied Japanese in Japan while working in them .
by improving their Japanese skills , in Japan they have the opportunity to get a job .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
he was at Sarah &apos;s house when suddenly he left all the bathroom dirty and went to his house .
so he went back to Sarah &apos;s house and clean all the bathroom , but Sarah already knew that he left the bathroom like this so before Michael entered to the bathroom she said : &quot; I know what you leave there &quot; and Michael went running to the bathroom .
Hi Julie ,
my school is located in the centre of the city in Bang@@ al@@ ore , India .
my school has a unique reputation for their friendliness and the quality of education .
I like my maths teacher very much because her teaching style is very realistic and simple to understand .
good Morning :
this is an essay about my favourite sport , it is swimming since I was a child because always enjoy a lot and what is more I can do it alone , I never refuse to go swimming pool and less in summer , of course .
I do n&apos;t have friends who like swimming , almost like football or similar teams sports , and always I go alone it is n&apos;t boring for me furthermore , I prefer going alone because anybody bother me or I have n&apos;t wait anybody .
I said that because when I was eleven my best friend had been operated on her back and before the operation he came with me and every day I had to wait for her because she spent a lot of time in the shower cleaning her long hair , I hated that !
luckily the operation was fine and she left to come with me , and since that day I go for my own .
swim is a relaxing exercise for me and normally there are n&apos;t many people in the pool , but sometimes there are children and I do n&apos;t like so much because they like disturbing me but sometimes it is amusing too .
I would recommended to people who not know swim to learn , because I am pretty sure that it like it and later they can stop swim .
I think that dance is a way for self - expression .
it &apos;s not just a hobby , it &apos;s more than this .
dance is a passion , a type of life .
when I &apos;m dancing I forget all my problems , except my stupid companions that they do n&apos;t understand anything .
but this is another theme for speaking .
when you dance , sing , or act you are showing something to the public , something that &apos;s important por you .
if dance is your passion , you practise every day , and you &apos;ll keep practise all the days until you can .
if you are tired does n&apos;t matters , because you like that you &apos;re doing .
you &apos;ll wake up early for going dance , or do dance classes .
you do n&apos;t matter if you go to sleep late , or do n&apos;t sleep ...
that &apos;s a joke , you must sleep .
if you love dance , you &apos;ll understand me .
members of my family .
I love my family special my little sister , she has sixteen years old , I consider my best friend because I used to tell her everything of my life .
I have a dog it name &apos;s chan@@ te , it is a golden retri@@ ever .
it &apos;s a lover dog , he knows how I feel .
my oldest sister her name hy@@ ac@@ in@@ th , she is really weird with me .
our relation is not good because she is so different to me .
also I have a brother his name is Jose Luis he has twenty years old , his personality is dynamic and funny .
my mom and my dad , they are a good guys .
actually I prefer pass my time alone , I am working in other town so I stay away from my family .
Hi ms .
Kate Ashby ,
how are you ? I hope you are well .
for work in our cafe you have to speak English of course , maybe know how to cook some type of sweet foods like cup@@ cakes , cake , cookies or brow@@ nies , the most popular foods of this year .
another thing that you must know it &apos;s how to deal with people , we are searching for someone who can impress everyone , also someone who can bring the customers good attention and service .
we need someone ready for work long hours , because our cafe is going to open every day .
that &apos;s all , see you soon
kisses ,

we think that in the future the planet will be in bad conditions and the trees will be disappearing , after that we will be having wars .
in 30 years we will have changed our anatomy , also we will be eating fast food , on the other hand , the north pole will have melted totally .
the temperature will have become crazy by global warming , so some people will have died because the natural disasters will be more aggressive .
the Technology will have advanced and maybe the cars will be flying by streets and computers will have totally changed .
because of this , we have to raise awareness of what is happening and we help the planet .
friendship is something very important in my life .
I ca n&apos;t imagine my lifetime without friends .
how to make friends and meet new people ?
it is easier than you think .
just ... start talking !
communication is the most important point when you &apos;re going to make friends .
you have to remember , that friends are not supposed to agree on every single thing .
they just have to calm talk about it .
if your friendship is real , you will always find point between your opinion and your friend &apos;s one .
just try , it wo n&apos;t cost you much !
good day ,
my name is F@@ ou@@ ad and I would like to talk about my favorite sport , Vol@@ leyball one of the most beautiful sports ever and I used to practise this sport 3 times a week since 1980 , the reasons for my enjoyment with this sport are as follows :
1- make me fit and healthy
2- class@@ y game no fri@@ ction between players
3- it exercise all muscles of your body
regarding the above I advice all roo@@ kies to start practise this sport and they will get many benefits .
however , the adults they can practise it as well and they will get the same .
as citizens of village , we totally care about environment of our village .
every Sunday , we do a mutual cooperation where anyone can treat rubbish as good as they treat themselves .
we clean the dirty ditch , sweep rubbish then we bury rubbish .
whilst , we recycling inorganic rubbish too .
from inorganic , we can make bag , hat and other stuffs .
then they can sell them and get income of it .
the creator of the haven and the earth , the creator of sol@@ es , the one who make earth rotate around it self and around the sun .
what we belief as Muslims that , we have created by one who do n&apos;t have other with him the one who create our father ( Adam ) and created from him ( Eve ) and they were in the Paradise and instructed to not eat from the tree but the Sat@@ an deceive them so they brought to this life and generations came from them and had sent the prophet and mess@@ engers ( Mos@@ es , Jesus , Mohamed , others .. who they worship the same one ) with Mir@@ acles and evidence of the truth , to guide the people to know who who will follow the truth which will guide to the Paradise and who follow other paths which it will guide to the hell . so because of that we are here to do the test in this short life .
transportation is the heart of any city whether it is public or private .
nowadays people prefer own vehicles rather than
public transportation . day by day folk are more crazy about own vehicles which leads dark future of public transportation
firstly . I agree with given statement that there would be tough time for public transportation in near future . because people wants privacy as well as freedom which is quite impossible in public transportation .
secondly these mode of transportation covers
as much as possible of city area or town which mism@@ an@@ aged routine who travelled by public transportation . as a consequence generally people avoid travelling by public transportation finally I can say that there are various mode of transportation available
to competition with public transportation .
nowadays people have numerous option fro travelling like many private company
which play an important role to give tough competition to government . as a result of this consumer gets more benefit like lower fa@@ ire , privacy , freedom and safe travelling . in addition many automobile company launching new car with affordable price which insist people to use more and more private vehicle .
I go for a walk to a park every day with my lovely two C@@ org@@ i dogs .
I met many people in the park .
I never thought about , people got so many pet .
in the peak time in the park is very busy even thought the park is huge !
some people are very friendly the same as their dog .
but some people are very rude and their dogs are aggressive to other dogs .
family is the most important institution of social life .
every member have his own role and the boss , the father or the mother , have to guide his team to understand the right behaviour or attitude to have with life .
usually there are generation problems , sons do n&apos;t understand parents and cer@@ vices , but dialog and listening emotions and facts , everyone can have another point of view .
parents must give rules to sons to under@@ line limits in social behaviour but also must listen others point of views to ri - arrange and update his knowledge .
a mother or a father can be a friend if there is communication and trust , if someone give his contribute in family duties .
recently I saw the thriller of mo@@ king@@ j@@ ay part 2 .
if you want to see that movie , you need to watch the first 3 movies before to understand it .
the first movies , were amazing ! !
a lot of action , drama and romance .
the fans of this series , had been wanting for this movie science the the first movie appeared , that was in 2012 .
I do n&apos;t think that this movie is for all the family , because is hard for little kids to understand , in opinion I think is more a teen movie .
I think people will like this movie because , its very similar to the story of the book ; this one of the first movie that is really based in the book , the theme is very unique and original , also the actors in the first movies were perfect , and I think that in the last movie , they will put double effort .
hope you guys choose this movie ! !
it will be very cool to see the las part mo@@ king@@ j@@ ay !
my favourite sport is Karate .
first of all , I enjoy it because when I practise I feel I can hold on for hours .
when I &apos;ve had a very bad and stressful day I can relax doing karate , because It &apos;s the kind of sport that it is n&apos;t very hard .
training Karate is a way to forget your problems , to forget your tiring routine .
in my opinion , it &apos;s very difficult to find this advantage with others sports .
apart from that , Karate it &apos;s not just a sport , is also a discipline , it teach you respect , balance even culture .
my teacher show us how we have to behave with others and he teach us a lot of things about the Japanese culture .
for someone who starts Karate is easy to follow the class , so my advice is just not to get nervous and to be concentrated on what he or she is doing .
technology , is something that is very important , something without which we can not live .
today topic is Technology .
nowadays we use technology in every thing , from educa@@ tions to making clothes , we use technology everyday and everywhere .
technology is always upgrading and it is very helpful , useful and important for development but today generation is influenced wh@@ it technology that they have stopped to do other activities .
last year , My friend Michael was at school when he heard about a short story competition , he liked the idea so he decided to enter the competition .
but there was a fees in order to join the competition , he had no money . fortunately he have a lot of friends they can lent him .
he phoned me and asked me to lent him some money to register the competition .
he took the money the second day , he finished the registration and started in writing the story after long time spending in writing and did good job he went to give his story to the international student magazine office , he found out there are a notice on the door say that the competition has canceled , he came back vey sad and told me what happened . Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had a mistake .
travelling by car is n&apos;t so much more convenient unless it is so much more comfortable , but actually we do n&apos;t think about the contamination in our planet .
travelling by bus is very stressful because the people push me or I ca n&apos;t sit down because there are n&apos;t any chair for me .
on the other hand , in the future maybe would have a bus which having chair for everybody and I do n&apos;t have to stand up .
other transport public is the taxi like car , it is so more comfortable too but it is more expensive than bus or train .
the A@@ ve or aeroplane are a good option for long trip .
in conclusion , in the future should have a bus so more comfortable .

dear sir D@@ im@@ ara .
I am writing about a problem at my city .
I live at Pat@@ r@@ as a big city in Greece .
in my city all schools and some walls of buildings are full of drawings and writing .
the vand@@ alism in Pat@@ r@@ as has increased a lot .
unfortunately when we say to somebody to do not draw the walls but they do not hear us .
for our city it is very bad because when some new people visit Pat@@ r@@ as they see that thing .
Pat@@ r@@ as is a very beautiful city and for her culture , and for her monuments .
why to see that a bas@@ er thing ?
after we have this beautiful city we have to maintain her .
in my opinion the police should stop the V@@ and@@ ali@@ s@@ me .
if it have police all around the city nobody will dare to do a graffiti or to write something or to draw .
I hope you will do something for that problem .
yours faithfully ,
Jess@@ y@@ ka st@@ av@@ ros .
all around the world pupils are waiting for finishing school .
they are eager to begin a new life as adults .
but when they reach in - between period , confused feelings cross their minds .
as a rule after last exams they do n&apos;t know what university to choose .
what they will do in future they see , like in a fog .
in this way , idea of a year off between leaving school and starting next education is very reasonable .
firstly it &apos;ll allow young people to have a rest after the first hard - work studying period .
ten or eleven years at school make them tired , in spite of pupils do n&apos;t notice it .
but choosing the second education is very important step , which need serious attitude .
secondly such year off would give to future students a chance to try themselves in new professional spheres .
also they would have an opportunity being involved in vol@@ on@@ tier activity .
and thir@@ dly they might work for earning own money or travel .
this year holiday would be really helpful for relaxation and ge@@ tt@@ in new power for future education .
one year is not long period .
but benefits after year off will be obvious .
I live in San M@@ ig@@ uel Al@@ m@@ olo@@ yan , this is a village in the municipality of Al@@ m@@ olo@@ ya de Ju@@ are@@ z in the State of Mexico , the care of the environment is very important and in my village they take different actions in the care of this .
people collects trash of their house and await the trash truck that carried the trash to a landfill located outside the village .
also , people go out to collect the trash that there is on the ki@@ osk , the church or in the principal places on the village .
dear Sir ,
I am interested to improve my English , so I am writing to request further information about the English course .
firstly , I would like to know how long the course lasts , and if it is possible the date exactly , because I need to book my flights .
secondly , I do n&apos;t live in C@@ ork , so it would be grateful if you could send me details of accommodation that you offer in this course .
and also , can you give me an idea of how much it would be cost every different options ? .
it would be useful if I can live with other students , because it is a good way to learning a language as well .
lastly , Let me know if I need to pass any level test before starting .
I look forward to hearing from you .
yours faithfully .

Peter looked at his watch and knew that he had to do something immediately , after listening conversations of his new neighbours .
they are planning to rob a very precious thing from Museum tonight .
he does n&apos;t have much time to prove their plan and he could not wait to let it happen .
it is his town and it is his duty too to save town &apos;s history .
he called the police and informed about his neighbours robbery plan .
police reached Museum and caught robbers red handed .
I am believing that there is no future for the public transport , using trains is m@@ or convenient and low expenses also to decrease the carbon gases which affecting the ozone , people should be aware about the effect of using the public transportation on the economics and environment , government shall enlarge the people to use the other ways for transport , this subject shall be issued in all media to learn and encourage the people to use he wright way for transport .
Hello Est@@ ela !
how are you ? I hope you are well .
I &apos;m writing because I tell you about my last summer holiday .
I went to Las Hur@@ des .
I stayed about one week in the home my boyfriend .
I had a wedding .
while I was there , I did a lot of things .
one day , I visited Me@@ an@@ dro del m@@ eller .
it was beautiful .
and there was a wonderful view .
the other day , I walked a lot and the end the way , we found a waterfall .
the name of waterfall was Ch@@ or@@ ri@@ tu@@ elo .
it was spectacular .
the wedding day , I had a great time and I slept very late .
the wedding was in the morning , and at the afternoon we ate in the restaurant with other people .
however , in the night , we had dinner in a garage and there was a party , all night .
you should visit Las Hur@@ des , It is a beautiful site .
and there are a lot of things .
and the people are very nice .
English is an international language which becomes important for the modern world .
in China , English is took to be a foreign language which many students choose to learn .
they begin to study English at an early age .
they use at least one hour to learn English knowledge a day .
even kids in kindergarten have begun learning simple words .
that &apos;s a good phenomenon , for English is essential nowadays .
in addition to , some people think English is superior than Chinese .
in me opinion , though English is for great significance , but English is after all a foreign language .
it is hard for people to see eye to eye .
English do help us read English original works , but Chinese helps us learn a true China .
only by characters Chinese literature can send off its brilli@@ ance .
learning a country &apos;s culture , espe@@ cial its classic culture , the first thing is learn its language .
because of we are Chinese , why do we give up our mother tongue and learn our ow@@ ne culture through a foreign language ?
I was , last month , in a fantastic restaurant , Woo@@ l@@ yp@@ ools .
it is small but comfortable and famous for his big burgers .
Woo@@ l@@ yp@@ ools is a specialist of meal , it &apos;s a meal restaurant .
in my opinion the restaurant can be better , respect to meat , but it is perfect to have dinner with your friends .
I have expects to be more famous , better and biggest .
the problem of the restaurant is the place , it is far from the people and cities , and the space , that is very small for lots of people .
in this life we have many things that make us happy and make our lives go on .
for example , a present or a gift especially if it from your best friend .
once , I got sick and stayed at general hospital , and my friend gave me a flower .
it was my favorite flower I have it ever .
in my town we create a small organization for more healthy environment , beauty touch and to be attractive . the citizens in the town must participate in this , the citizen will take the responsibility for specific day to clean the town and put the rubbish into correct place and clean tree and plant more of it .
I &apos;m agree with the opinion that the famous people , such as politicians and film stars deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time .
is horrible have a person behind you all the time , you not have a life , not peace , not a happy .
in addition all persons have the right to privacy and to be free .
nevertheless the journalists stay all the time having a photo , all the time , when they eaten , drinking , happy , sad , how is your love life and with whoever stay , if stay with something important our what buy .
this is terrible , you do not have privacy although the society have a blame , because if they do not take a photo our follows the life of the famous the people bored .
so that , politicians and film stars will have support it , because then they will have to bear it , because they then have the reward with what they earn .
this is all .
good morning .
how are you .
come here .
get down .
get in to the room .
get in to the bus .
let us walk .
let us play cards .
let us sleep .
let me in .
let me go .
let me see your photos .
let me watch your house .
let me allow to enter in to your cabin .
forgive me . :
bring that toy .
bring glass of water .
drink water .
eat food .
run fast .
stop shouting . do n&apos;t shout .
let us bath .
once upon a time was one little ant called Penny , he was really small in compared with the others .
he hated to be like that because most of the ants made fun of him until one day something horrible and inevitable happen .
it was a dark night it was raining until a big active volcano explosion buried them into the underground .
all of them tried to find a way out ! , but no one ca n&apos;t find one ... They started to get panicked !
people just started to evacuated rapidly until it began a big earthquake ...
penny was too sad , the only thing that he can do is to wait and keep calm .
until the dawn all of them go out , so they sacred until they find a refuge .
everyone wanted to witness the queen , but no one find something .
like they were very religious ants they prey for her sacred ancestors so they can help them in the big deal .
something that they don know was that the whole thing was a movie !
so all was planned ...
the actors had monitors that watch the ants all the time .
one day Penny discovered it and it go to tell it to his queen , the queen at knowing that she get very confused but at the same time she get mad and she wanted revenge .
so they make a plan to display all ...
the next day when they were about to start filming they E@@ re non ants there so they search for them , but they ca n&apos;t find them ...
in that moment the ants and Penny attack them in their backs , making them to leave the place .
the ants win the war and they expand their habitat to the studio .
no one attack them again and they live happily ever after !
I have many favorite sports .
one of them I &apos;m keen on playing basketball the best . I always spend more time on playing it .
I usually play basketball everyday around at least thirty minutes per day .
after a hard day at University I go home and then I go to the stadium to play it .
one thing makes sure that I already finished all of my work before I play my favorite sport .
basketball has many benefits not to me but also everyone .
it makes me feel relaxed and unwind .
besides , it also helps me keep fit and have a good body shape .
I really era
Y@@ z about playing it .
when I have spare time , I often gather my friends to watch basketball match on television .
I often play basketball at the stadium in the morning .
sometimes , I play it near sports centre .
I go back home and have a sleep deeply when I finished it .
basketball is an outdoor activity .
that &apos;s reason why basketball is my favorite sport .
with the sweeping progress of development and the booming of population , many agricultural land , forest and ocean had been used to destroyed to build more constructed and transport networks .
from my own perspective , I believe that it will bring many drawbacks to the environment or even human and animals .
to start with , there are a wide range of troublesome it maybe adding to this phenomenon .
convincing arguments can support that the root cause is that almost all the present day cities are already packed with places of residence , commerce and recreation and the land available for new housing developments is increasingly scarce .
additionally , people now continues destroyed more agriculture and forest in order to satisfy all their need , which will dist@@ ort the ecosystem diversity and bio@@ diversity especially the endangered species .
according to the problems above mentioned , various approaches that government should be adopted to deal with this problem . first of all , reducing building constructed from now on , planting more trees instead .
Su@@ st@@ ain@@ ad@@ le development should be awareness to all human and start to port@@ ent the environment and preserve the animals .
to sum up , this unpleasant phenomena and problems should be worked out to resolve before thing get worse ang the governments have to take the responsibility for that .
nowadays the languages are very important , and more English .
this is not my first time that I study English .
I have been studying English since I was child and I never speak and learn so well since I decided to go to London one course to learn this language .
I have taken that decision because I was tired to try to learn English and I did not have the level that I want , so when I heard about that opportunity I said yes .
the car is n&apos;t the best way for for the transport , because it produce much pollution , however the public transport is better to do a journey .
it can carry many people without problems .
nowadays in the cities developed there are many possibilities for public transport , like bus , train , subway , tram etc . these options it &apos;s more economical than the car , the problem of the car is that normally the car is occupied for a person , when the car is prepared for to carry four or five people .
this situation to create many pollution for environment so we have more conscience for the planet health
I want to say something about the learning of the English langu@@ aj@@ e , is hard to get to me for the next reasons :
first reason ; the grammar that the learners , teachers or institutes teach , is like the Spanish langu@@ aj@@ e , my native langu@@ aj@@ e .
that I want to say , is very difficult to understand the conju@@ gation of the verb &apos;s in Spanish langu@@ aj@@ e , just Imag@@ ing you the same but not in your native len@@ gu@@ aj@@ e .
second reason . in the English syn@@ tax , the structure for construction paragraph or sentences , the verb is written before the subject , but no always , Which is the rule ?
is there anyone ?
the third reason :
I love to play cricket .
I am enthusiastic towards this game .
my favourite team is India because I belongs to this country .
in India , 85 percent people follow cricket .
in 1993 , Indian cricket team won his first world cup and that &apos;s change the direction of air in favour of cricket and everyone start to follow this game .
I love this game because my favourite sport man belong to this game .
his name is Mr. Sach@@ in Ram@@ e@@ sh T@@ end@@ ul@@ ak@@ ar know as little master .
whenever I play this game , I always follow this person .
his stance , Style , shots , running between the wi@@ cket , everything which is most required in this game is up to the mark .
not only me but also every Indian always follow Sach@@ in for cricket .
when he was 18 , he played first game for India .
he is the first player who played 200 test in cricket .
he has many achievement like first 200 in one day etc .
I love the way he was played .
for a nuance first they have to decide what they con do better , batting or bowling .
if the person want to become bow@@ ler then concentrate on running , action , stance and for bat@@ sm@@ en need concentration on lag and bat coordination , eye and bat coordination , discover some shots which became key factor in batting .
also watch videos of some best player like Sach@@ in , R@@ a@@ hu@@ l , Sir D@@ on bread man , Hay@@ den , Was@@ im A@@ kar@@ am , Bre@@ tt Lee etc .
as health is important factor in every sport so also need to improve health , stamina .

I also want to introduce my friends to you , we can have fun together .
when you have played enough in this city , and you want to find a job here .

it may take very long time to find a job and you have not much time here .
you may consider my advice .
my favorite sport is swi@@ ms .

it is not be afraid of water , otherwise they may not learn swim and also when the age become older it will be more difficult to learn than the little .
so these are the advice that I give to them .
dear Camp director ,
my name is Ei@@ der and I am 21 years old . I had read your advertisement in the newspaper !
and I am really sure that I am the person that you are finding .
I am monitor in the free time , and I am looking for a tempor@@ al job to improve my English .
neither I have problems for working in a kitchen , will be clear if I told you that my parents have a bar .
according to my age , evening activities are not a problem for me , and I played many sports during my life , such as soccer , volleyball , ...
waiting for your answer , Ei@@ der
the city where I live is a small village .
all residents take great care of the environment .
organized shares , where everyone clean up the village .
all residents segregate garbage thrown into suitable containers .
thus helping to protect our environment to make it clean , safe , in order to not jeopardi@@ ze our various diseases .
in my village there are trash cans , so that no one threw debris on the ground .
there are speci@@ j@@ al@@ ni@@ h place where you can organize bon@@ fires , but everyone has to clean up after themselves and throw out all garbage .
we have the ability to use renewable energy sources , because it is close to a wind power plant .
recently , also on the roof of the primary school were set the batteries and the whole school uses solar energy instead of electricity .
they organize monthly meetings on the environment , residents participate in them .
W@@ s@@ z@@ y@@ sy@@ cy residents of my village , they try to , so that our village was clear that pollute the environment as little as possible .
travelling in their own car is way more comfortable than taking a ride in public transportation . there are several reason to consider .
firstly , the bus is always drop by to get a passenger that take a more time than expected to time of travel .
secondly , the public vehicle route are more far than usual route .
Thirdly , it is also crowded and no privacy .
finally , there is a chance to become a victim of theft and pocket pic@@ ker .
however , public transportation is much cheaper than to buy a new car and for the advent@@ urer who want to have an exciting travel for then to see more action .
like watching outside or sight seeing , to min@@ gle and meet different people .
in addition to this I also admire the bullet train in Japan which u consider fast and safe public vehicle I@@ ve@@ &apos;d known .
to sum it up I still consider having their own car is way more safe and convenient .
public future unless they have project to at least lessen the time of travel and prioritize the safety of their passenger .
as far as I &apos;m concerned , I tend to disagree with the decision of mineral extraction .
more details and reasons will be elabor@@ ated in the following paragraphs to support my opinion .
to begin with , extract the mineral will be harmful to our environment .
there are breathtaking sights on the outskirts of my hometown .
in my childhood , I went there to spend my summer every year .
however , it will probably be disappeared if the developing equipment were being set .
next to go will be , the extraction of the valuable mineral will definitely leads to air pollution .
there has been an example that the other town is polluted by the process of developing the mineral .
no one can deny that the pollution issue is one of the utmost important thing which should be prevented .
last but not the least , the mineral extraction will turn out to be profound influence , especially , to our offspring .
to take my friend , Taylor , as an example , her homeland were over - developed and become an ar@@ id place when she was a child .
after she grows up , she decides to leave and never go back to her hometown .
in addition , she has no bli@@ the memory in her childhood .
one problem is that some people will consider the job opportunity that it might bring to us .
due to the mineral development , many people in our hometown can probably earn much more money than before .
it seems like a sought - after chance .
nevertheless , they do not give us any promise of the vacancy .
in addition , money is no more crucial when it comes to health and environmental conservation .
in a nutshell , B@@ ased on the reasons and inst@@ ances above , the disadvantages of extract the valuable mineral are outweigh the advantage .
therefore , I do not subscribe to this decision .
limiting cars on the roads would cause the disappearing of poo .
the fossil fuels used by vehicles cause global warming .
global warming is a serious issue , higher temperatures make the ice caps melt .
the longer we bury our heads in sand , the warmer the Earth will be .
I learn English to improve the general quality of my sentences !
I do n&apos;t believe in it , especially while cars are not flying .
even if it will have happened there are many people who ca n&apos;t get a car , because it is too expensive , not only for buying but for fuel , service and so forth .
buses are more simple - you just buy a ticket .
and what about trains ?
I saw TV about train in Japan - that is the future of public transport .
I want to see blue sky and not stream of cars like it was in the film &quot; The Fi@@ fth Ele@@ ment &quot;

contemporary Art is a very controversial issue nowadays .
there are many sources and creators , as well as themes .
it is well known that many Art cur@@ ators and Arti@@ sts believes that Con@@ temporary Art is not a good source of art , since there are many artists that only create based in their easy ideas of an aesthetic image or a philosophical idea , but most of the times this is un@@ intel@@ ligible .
luckily the most expensive art still being the old , like Picasso or Fre@@ ud .
nowadays a lot of empty art pieces are being sold at au@@ ctions around the world , for extraordinary high prices .
experimental Art has taken the world of art by surprise .
humanity has reached a level of differences that it would be not possible to stop .
so now we have many choices and an infin@@ ity of information available at any given time .
with this stated , we now have an idea of how artists create .
the sports days were held on K@@ wa@@ i Chung Sports Ground in 12th and 13 th November .
that weather was partly cloudy .
I got there by MT@@ R .
I arrived the sports ground at 7@@ :@@ 40 a.m. This year I &apos;ve join the 100@@ -@@ metre race .
on the first day before the sports day begin , we have the opening ceremony .
the athletic representative pasted the tor@@ ch and we sang the anthem .
after that , the sports day began formally .
at 10@@ :@@ 45 a.m. , the girl &apos;s grade C 100@@ -@@ metre race started .
there was a funny thing when I went to the marsh@@ al .
the teacher call my name for twice and he told me to stand different place .
so I know that there was someone whose name pronounce same as me .
near the race , I was very nervous .
when I was running , I heard my house@@ mates cheering and the wind passing my face .
that feel was very comfortable and made me felt relax .
at last , I got number 10 out of 27 people .
although it is not a great result , I &apos;ve already try my best .
at last of the day , our school announced the mark the four houses have got .
my house which got number two temporarily .
I felt hopeful and wanted my house will get the champion .
on the second day , my classmates called me to take part the Inter - class relay race .
I felt very afraid because I was not good at running .
finally , our class got the first runner up .
we have a difference of 0.@@ 5 seconds is the first of the race .
I impli@@ cated my class from winning the champion .
at last , my house got the second runner up .
I hope my house will get the champion in the next year .
&quot; there is no future for public transport , because travelling by car is so much more convenient &quot; .
in my opinion , this affirmation is not correct .
we should used of public transport because at the present there are a lot of cars in the world that pollute and unfortunately we are har@@ ming the environment and the world .
it is the best that all people go to the place walking o running on the other hand it is more healthy .
there is nothing wrong with it go to the place in a car , obviously , it is faster than a bus and cheaper but no always .
I think it is true that travelling by car is so much more convenient but I disagree that there is no future for public transport .
is is commonly - debated that tourism has greatly influenced , not only the aspects of one country , but of the whole world along .
Whe@@ there tourism has had a positive or a negative impact over our lifes , it remains quite a dilemma for the ignorant .
first of all , tourism is a tool that enables people to travel all around the world .
alongside with its development , the ability of traveling has eased to such a scale that it is now quite common to commute from one country to another .
the existence of multin@@ ation@@ als is tightly connected to the idea of tourism , as well as with the idea of globalisation , since a traveller is not only a citizen of his own country but a global citizen .
secondly , tourism , especially in developed countries , has played an important part in their growing from an economic point of view .
there are countries , such as Greece or Bulgaria , in which the economy relies merely on tourism .
if tourism influences the economy , it thereby influences the environment , and if it influences the environment it influences the transport . how ? people become more careful at their historical sites , this way preserving them@@ ;@@ Transport is developed both at a small and a large scale :
at a small scale , in cities , in a way which will allow citizens and tourists alike to reach important places more efficiently .
at a large scale , people can now travel in almost any possible way : on land , on sea or air .
through the development of tourism were born cru@@ ises and train vacations .
one upon a time there was a tiger who lives in a beautiful landscape with her boyfriend and her 3 daughters .
the tiger was the mom names Amanda of 25 years old , the her@@ ders kill her parents , because the her@@ ders were poor and do n&apos;t have enough food to survive , so they kill them .
the tiger &apos;s boyfriend was a lion names John of 27 years old , his dad die because in a conflict with other animals , he got an infection .
her mom die because some things or someone drag her of the leg and drop it in a cave were other animals eat her .
they die when John was too little to remember and he never know what happened so he went to all the parts for saw them even he walked and walked even at reverse but he never found them .
the 3 daughters where so different each other .
the first one names Amanda junior like her mom but she is a chee@@ tah . she have 9 years old she loves to run and she is the fastest of the family and have a lot of spots .
she is of the ones that trend to make something en@@ forcing .
the second daughter names Elizabeth is a le@@ op@@ ard is the intelligent of the family and the oldest of the daughters .
had 12 years old .
another animals give them rewards or bonus because she discover that water was liquid .
the last daughter was Ana who was the youngest of the family is a J@@ agu@@ ar .
she stay sleeping in the bed and doing nothing all day .
their parents were angry because she was the only one that never work .
one they animals went with Ana and give her an incentive for being an athlete or make something else than stay sleeping .
the end .
Hello friend ,
I know you are searching for a flat to live for the whole next year .
maybe I found something for you : when I were on the bus returning to home I read a journal with some advertisements .
there is a nice flat near my home : it is perfect to someone who want to live there for only an year .
there are a little kitchen , a great bedroom , a bathroom with shower but without bath and a cool living - room .
I think that you have to bring with you winter clothes because here there is a really cold weather !
write me soon

Hello Riley , about the question you made me in your letter , it has been hard to give you an answer because I know how much you love both .
last night I made a decision .
I think that you should give up from your music classes .
you have classes since you were nine years old and you already know how to play piano , so I think that you should continue doing sports because it is important for your health and in your free times you could still play piano without going to the classes .
this is my opinion but the decision is yours , so when you decide it please send me a letter telling me about it .
love , In@@ es .
Hey my name is Joe and I &apos;m 21 years old and i@@ &apos;@@ l think i@@ &apos;@@ l would compliment the summer camp very good , because of my good manner and very open for the kids so they can open up and speak .
my current job is to be a nurse at the local hospital and i@@ &apos;@@ l can do everything as a doctor can .
so if the kids is going to hurt themselves , then i@@ &apos;@@ l can fix them up instead of taking them to the hospital for small things like bruises and smaller injuries .
the most exciting day of my life was the 3rd of June , last year .
I had an exam .
that day I woke up early because I was nervous .
then I revise Maths as at home , before to go at school , as at school , before to begin the exam .
when I started to read the tracks I fell agitated and I thought that I was n&apos;t able to finish and pass that test .
but when I finished before the time I was happy and relaxed .
I always said that I passed that test and I was sure of that .
and this is true .
I passed that test !
Hello Charlie ,
I &apos;m really enjoyed hearing from you .
congratulations your sister for your prize .
I would like to go to a new artist rolls competition , although in my city there are n&apos;t a lot of competitions of this kind If I &apos;d have a possibility of going , I &apos;d already spend the tickets .
my favourite sport
when I was three years old , my parents went skiing with me .
at the begin I went to the child garden and they taught me skiing .
it was a lot of fun , because I could not it .
at twelve o&apos;clock in the daytime my parents took me with them and we drove together .
my father took me between his knees , because I could drive without falling and it was fun .
when I was older , I could get better my dream was : &quot; snowboarding &quot; , but I should learn skiing perfectly like my parents .
later when I was 16 years old , my dream get true .
I had my first snowboard lesson und I loved it .
I took every free minute to drive snowboard .
that was the story why I go snowboarding .
I enjoy snowboarding , because you feel free when you are driving down the pi@@ ste .
you are like a bird .
it is the best feeling in the world .
you are very happy und sometimes I sing a song and the world is perfect .
that is everything I want to have and I &apos;m lucky .
that &apos;s why I like the winter more than the summer .
snowboarding or skiing is the best sport for everyone who want to come to other thoughts .
although you are all the time in the nature and when you have luck you can see animals .
it had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
yesterday , he was on his way to home and it was getting dark .
his parents were worried and called he a couple of times .
he started walking very quickly
everything was dark .
she open her eyes and the first thing that she saw was the black sky .
a dark sky without stars .
she got up and look around .
she was in a part of the woods where she used to go to think and relax .
she started to take consciousness although she could n&apos;t remember how she arrived there .
she had to walk at least 15 minutes to go from her house to this place .
the problem is the last thing she remember is that she has been sleeping and then suddenly woke up when the window opened with the wind .
she fell sleep again , did n&apos;t she ?
if she did , how she managed to walk until there in her sleep ?
if she was n&apos;t awake , why she could n&apos;t remember anything after that ?
this situation it was really frustrating not to mention that now she had to walk for almost 20 minutes to get home and back to sleep .
she started to walk to clear her mind .
she knows her way even in the dark ; she had gone to this spot a lot of time , specially the last few weeks .
the development of human kind in technology is seen everywhere .
in case of transportation technology , in this twenty first century we have various option like Plan that can fly with the cloud , train that fast and big enough that carry hundreds of people and travel hundreds of mile an hour and boat that much bigger and faster than ancient time .
although compared to ancient time we are lucky enough that we have all these option .
however , if I have given option to choose between all of three , I will say plane .
there are three reason to choose this .
first reason is its speed , compare to both other means of transportation it can travel faster .
it can travel thousand of miles in a couple of hours .
as a result people can save their time .
second is safety , compared to other the chances of accident is less .
that makes it safer to travel by plane rather than the train or boat .
third one is comfort level .
plan is much more more comfortable than both train and boat .
in conclusion , I will say that plan will be my first choice in all of three means of transportation .
the reason behind my choice is speed , safety and comfort level that make plan as my first choice .
everyone should take a year off between leaving school and starting college or university , to earn money or travel , it would be the best award for a student who attended the high school .
the young people want to discover the world and travelling to reach places which would be un@@ reach@@ able otherwise
I had a wonderful day yesterday because I was in the beach all the afternoon .
I went with my parents and my sister .
the beach is located in A Guar@@ da and its name is O Mu@@ i@@ ño .
there are a lot of people in the beach .
the water was very cold and I could n&apos;t swim , then I played football in the sand of the beach .
I took the sun a very long time and then I go to a cafe and and I drank a refreshment .
it was a nice day because I spent a good time with my family .
no future for a public transport ? is this claim or no ?
will we see on our roads the public transport af@@ er 5 or eve 10 years yet ? that is really so interesting question@@ /
I think that it all depends from the development .
now we can see that more and more people prefer travelling by car .
yes , I agree , if you planed the travelling for a long disti@@ ll@@ ation and for a long time you would prefer to do it on car , cause firstly you@@ ;@@ ll spend less time , you travelling will be comfortable , you &apos;ll have a possibility to stop every where and for a long time , as you need .
but if we are talking about travelling across you city , would you prefer public transport or car ?
I think that this is the question for every one , and the answer ca n&apos;t be one for all , cause , someone can use public transport , and economy by this not only money , but and the environment , but some people do n&apos;t like to use p . T . , cause they spend more time for travelling or they simple do n&apos;t like to travel with another people .
so , on my opinion , even after 10 years the public transport will be crossing on our street with enough amount of passengers
Hello Lara ,
thank you for your email .
my name is Mohamed and I am 28 years old male from the kingdom of Bah@@ rain .
I go to G@@ Y@@ M and run on a daily basis to keep in shape and good health .
looking forward to know more about you .
my village is the place where I live so I am trying to keep its environment non - polluted and valid for life .
in order to attain this goal I have to take steps and actions to protect the environment as follows :
no smoking in the public places .
increasing the number of tries and plants and punish the person who cuts them .
establishing the factories outside of the village .
protect the water sources and the sea .
guide the people and giving them of information , details and guidelines about the pollution .
I &apos;d like to tell you about my favorite restaurant its name is &quot; L@@ emon &quot; I go there every week it has different food from any restaurants I &apos;d like chicken crispy with garlic sauce It &apos;s Excell@@ ent choice for me and My favorite appetiz@@ er is sausage and in order that desert I &apos;d rather &quot; V@@ ad@@ ge &quot; cake with chocolate sauce I feel I@@ ;@@ m at ease when I go there I enjoy classical music over having a lunch about the service It &apos;s very good and all staff are respectable I ca n&apos;t imagine one week without going there that drives me nuts I advise any one to go there and enjoy a time there , also this restaurant has a relative advantage in hygiene really It &apos;s excellent This stri@@ kingly thing for anyone despite all of these advantages prices are not expensive .
volleyball in one of the most difficult sports in the world , you should put your body in the correct form to throw the ball to the other side in the game .
I been twelve years practice volleyball and because of it I knew lot of people who help me to grow up in the sport and life .
when I was 10 I be choose to play with a group of girls older than me , they were goods , and I ca n&apos;t believe the experience .
volleyball its my favorite sport because when I am with my team playing I were in another world , in which I can be free and happy , apart of this , when I am bad , this is a distraction of the university .
you should try practice its so funny , but I advertise you , is not easy at first , but you have to intent many times like you should do in life .
in weekdays , I get off from my bed at 7 in the morning to go to my work which starts at 9 AM .
I often go to sleep around 12 AM .
I usually play videos games if I do not have any homework to do .
I am not a big fan of sports so I do not play any .
however I sometimes do a skipping to fit myself .
Michael wake up at the morning and he read the newspaper .
he read in the newspaper an interesting notice .
the notice was about a competition .
the competition is about write stories .
Michael was excited because he is great writer and he decided to compete .
first , he found an idea for the story and he decided to make the story about pirates looking for treasure .
he began to write .
the story was very good but Micha@@ e did not know how to end the story .
finally , Michael ended the story and he went to the post office .
Michael sent the story but Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake , he did n&apos;t put his name and address .
yes , I think TV can entertain and educate , because there are many comedy .
also there are a lots of educate channels .
I think historical channels are very interesting , because you can learn new thing about past .
comedies are so funny , so when you are sad u can watch one of them .
there are many discussions about the future of the public transport .
different experts had talked about this question and there are so several opinions .
people like to have the freedom for moving comfortably and for this reason , some people usually prefer to use their cars .
public transport usually is restricted with the timetables and you only may use the transport in the moment that the timetable let you .
for this way , many people do n&apos;t like to use the public transport because they want to move themselves when they need .
by the other hand , public transport is better for the environment , because the pollution is lesser than using your own car .
finally , in the future , the commodity of people maybe is going to determin@@ ate the most use of the cars than the public transport .
Susan is a little dragon .
her skin is colored red and green , red dots on top of the green to be more precise .
she does that every day after school .
of course , she has also a little brother .
his skin is colored red , just like the father .
dear Paul !
I have n&apos;t written you for ages but I was very busy because of the exams at the University .
what about you ? what &apos;s new in Brazil ? as you know , my friend John asked me to help him with the organization at the concert , which was performed last month .
so I was there something like staff .
my work consisted of making press advertising , providing all ticket , food for musicians and things like that .
I got two free V@@ .@@ I.@@ P tickets , so I took my girlfriend and we were there together .
when the concert finished , we went to clo@@ ak@@ room to get signatures from musicians .
I felt like a star ! crowded of people were waiting in front of the clo@@ ak@@ room for the signatures , but only me and my sweet girlfriend got them .
people were so envious ... I liked it ! it was fantastic experience .
next time I would like to do something similar and you should try it as well . you will earn nice money and you have cultural experience .
it &apos;s a dual effect !
hope to see you soon
John
the advertising is every site .
there are adds in TV , radio , bus , streets ...
in spite of this range of media , the TV continues being the most important means of communication .
a lot of people think that there are too many adds on television but , is like that ?
on one hand , it &apos;s true that one programme or series which we see , has a lot of mentions to products or services .
there can be people tired of so much advertising contents but this is completely necessary .
there are a lot of products which have to be announced and a lot of messages to report to people .
the TV is the most accessible way of communication and people can see the messages on this way .
in addition , behind one add there are a lot of things : one industry .
in one add there are , for example , the publici@@ st &apos;s work , the companies investments , future sales , the product or service &apos;s life ...
to sum up , there are a lot of adds in TV but they are necessary and beneficial for everyone .
my favourite season of the year is summer .
why am I making this choice you clearly can ask , I love sun and good weather .
yes it is true that during summer the temperature is very hot and you can rarely stay near the sun because you finish t be burn by the sun .
in spite of this , summer is a very good moment to enjoy little things life gives us and have fun with them .
during summer I love to go to the beach and having sunbathing with my friends other than getting fun with them playing volleyball or run inside the water of the sea !
I think those activities are very re@@ generating and they make you forget about all the awareness of summer .
furthermore you can sleep more than the other days of the year and this make you feel relaxed .
I really like to explore nature during summer too .
the wonderful colours of flowers with the sunshine are fabulous .
dear USA SUMMER camps ,
I saw your advertisement in the USA and I &apos;m very interested in the position of child min@@ der you are advertising .
I &apos;m eighteen years old and I &apos;m doing a languages translation degree at university at the moment , that &apos;s why I need to work in order to pay my fee .
I have some experience working with children from all ages , besides I do n&apos;t mind hard work and I learn quickly .
also I &apos;ve just got my FCE certificate this year but it would help me a lot if I practised my English in a native country .
I consider myself really active , sociable , well - organized and above all patient , therefore I think I &apos;m suitable for this job as I can adapt myself easily at any kind of situation or environment , especially working overseas plus it would be a nice experience because I would meet new people and a different culture .
I &apos;m looking forward to hearing from you soon .
yours faithfully ,

it had been a very long and tiring day , but Tom felt he had achieved something really good .
he finally , after 5 years , won swimming competition .
it was really important for him because he was training for 5 long years since he was 15 and he have n&apos;t got any achievements .
he was very happy and he decided to celebrate .
he invited all his friends from team and made a party .
Tom wanted Mel , his girlfriend , to come too .
she was really proud of him .
she was dreaming about being his wife .
she wanted to be his wife so bad .
but he did n&apos;t love her enough .
he wanted to break up with her at that party .
he was waiting 2 hours for her .
he hated that she is always late .
that was the main reason he wanted to end it up .
when Mel came she looked gorgeous .
and when he saw her , his heart started to beating faster and faster .
but time &apos;s up .
he got closer to her and told her everything .
Mel looked sadly at Tom , then said : &quot; I &apos;m pregnant ... &quot; and got out of his home .
he followed and apologized her .
he said he was drunk and did n&apos;t know what he was saying .
then he hugged her .
he said he loved her and kissed her forehead .
he had to stay with her because of ... the baby .
he could n&apos;t just leave her carrying his baby !
no ! he has never acted like this .
he knew that he had to stay with her the rest of his life and raise the baby .
he decided to give swimming up and started to taking care of Mel .
one day Mel was feeling really bad so Tom took her to the hospital .
he felt that something bad was going to happen .
and he was right .
Mel has lost the baby .
Tom had to make a hard decision .
his life was going to change .
Mel was crying all day and Tom could n&apos;t stand it .
he has broken up with Mel and it made her much more sad .
he did n&apos;t care .
he thought it was her fault that she has lost their little human .
gli@@ ding in the waves
even if I am not a very interested in training , the sport I really prefer to practice is swimming .
the sensation of being embraced by the water , feeling the body quite without weigh , able to do a lot of movement that are impossible while in the air , is a wonderful state of mind .
I started to practice swimming in pool because I was n&apos;t able to swim at all , and I wanted to learn .
I have been taking lessons for six months , so I improved so much my abilities .
if you are not a good swimmer , you lose the big part of pleasure of enjoying the water , both in the sea or in pool .
practice swimming is quite hard work , especially if you need to learn the basic movements , but it is a very relaxing activity .
I recommend that you do n&apos;t have to give up before trying , because is fairly simple and it can gives a lot of satis@@ fac@@ tions !
your efforts will be pri@@ zed by succ@@ eeding , and you can obtain it with practice .
·@@ Introduction
this report will examine the different activities we can do in our leisure time in Castell@@ def@@ els .
·@@ Activities to kill time
as our town is well - known for our magnific@@ us beaches along the Mediterranean coast and for the Olympic Can@@ al of Castell@@ def@@ els , many foreign or local people come here to do activities like kitesurfing and windsurfing on the beach or canoeing and aquatic skiing on the Olympic Can@@ al .
these activities are the most popular and the most expensive too .
however , I fully recommend them , especially for sporty , adventurous and young people .
·@@ Others ideas to have fun
in Castell@@ def@@ els , there are other activities less popular , but cheaper , for instance : free rum@@ ba master@@ class , yoga beach , running ... as sports activities , and as social activities there are library group , theatre ...
as I said , these activities are not as popular as the activities of the Olympic Can@@ al and the beach , but their success is increasing more and more .
·@@ Re@@ commend@@ ation
so , finally I suggest that it would be a great idea to combine the different types of activities , both popular and the newest .
if you tried all the activities , you would spend a great time here , in Castell@@ def@@ els !
Hi Jane ,
how are you ? .
I was glad to hear from you .
I &apos;m writing to tell you the best way to arrive at Sal@@ ou .
you will come to the Re@@ us airport , right ? .
well , the airport is located just outside Re@@ us , it &apos;s small but it has a lot of services and transport .
you have to take a bus because it is more economical than take a taxi .
the bus stops at the Sal@@ ou bus station .
when you get off the bus you should ask someone for the Spring Street .
it &apos;s near there .
you can walk to my house .
moreover I send you a map in order to locate the street .
this is my address : 4 Spr@@ uce avenue .
I &apos;m planning your visit .
I &apos;d like to visit museums , monuments and going to clubbing with you .
I &apos;m looking forward to hearing from you soon .
best Regards ,
Mary

nowadays there are many people that are learning foreign language , for me is a good thing that more people learn this , but is it worth learning a foreign language ?
firstly , there are more multinational companies that need people to speak other languages , so that means that the people who know to speak foreign language have more opportunities to get a job in important companies , or will have more chances of being promoted .
on the other hand , are more benefits , for example , if you want to travel to another a country is very useful to know a different language , because you can understand all without complications .
finally , learning another language gives the learner the ability to step inside the mind and context of that other culture .
today globalization is bringing the world more close , that means that there are more possibilities to have contact with the other cultures , for example in literature , poetry , films , TV programs , music or some other aspect of the culture .
on balance , learning foreign languages is very positive on different aspect , so if you have the posi@@ tivity of learning a new language do it , because it will bring you many benefits .

given is a diagram introducing the procedures of making bank notes .
des@@ gin the bank notes are the first and indispensable step .
pe@@ ple should decide the background colour and the artwork while they have to consider the security issues .
then , skilled machinists would prepare the metal plates in order to go to the next step .
the third section is to print the prepared bank notes .
usually there will be 50 ban notes per sheet .
the colour will print on the both sides and every notes has their unique ink also the images will be slightly raised .
after that , it comes to the most significant stage , that is inspect the quality of the printed sheets .
people usually divided the quality into three parts : good quality , partially damaged , and bad sheets .
as for good quality sheets and partially damaged sheets but still good , people will cut them separately and pack them together in order to distracting and distribu@@ ting the bank notes .
if the partially damaged sheets are bad , they will be treated as bad sheets , which will be securely distorted .
in conclusion , the diagram gives a quite explicit process of making bank notes .
eventhough it seems to be easy to make them , but every steps needs people to be very careful in order to produce the perfect bank notes for everyone .

everything began a few years before , when Alfred , The Major , read an article about the importance of the surroundings in health and happiness of people .
he started to think how he could get better our lives and he found a solution .
a concerned population
while youngsters use their time trying to get concerned the oldest people from de village about the importance of the care of our surroundings , middle - aged people planted many trees around the village and cleaned the floor of our public places making a more attractive place to live than we used to have .
easy recycling
local authorities helped this initiative creating some places for people to leave their rubbish in order to be taken to the recycling center with the purpose of giving a new life to our waste .
the results
as a result of this attitude , since Alfred had this great idea , we enjoy one of the cleanest villages in the area .
people now is worried about the future of our planet and an association has been created in order to promote the care of our planet , Green Planet is called .
we want a happy Earth .
Hello Luis Bl@@ anc@@ o ,
I &apos;m writing you about the staff recruitment for the &quot; New Cloud Generation &quot; project .
so we need your help with some questions about the process .
for your information , we are looking for people with three years of experience in similar projects , who are engineers and also have a high team work skill .
we also value that they have specialised studies in Cloud technology , and hosting management .

is it possible to do the meeting this week ?
when and where do you prefer ? ( remember that I work from 8 a . m to 6 p . m ) I suggest we can do the meeting at your office , so you do n&apos;t have to move to another place .
finally I need you to prepare some profiles that you think the staff of New Cloud Generation should have , and please tell me if you find another different request than I tell you before in that e - mail .
please , answer me with the information as soon as possible .

dear Paul ,
what &apos;s up ?
do you remember when I told you I had been helped at a concert ?
it was really exciting and unforgettable experience and I enjoy that very much .
you probably wo n&apos;t believe me but I met all members of D@@ ż@@ em band , I talked to them and we had lunch together , they &apos;re very nice men . because of helping them I had the best place during the concert and I have their autographs on the newest record . I did n&apos;t have many duties and none of them were unpleasant .
in general I had only one duty that is checking quest list , above that I had to help in cleaning area after the concert .
but that concert was worth of my work , so I hope I will be invited to their next event .
working for them was a real pleasure .
I suppose we &apos;ll see each other soon and I &apos;ll be capable of talking to you about this experience .
love ,

report :
the aim of this report is to give you my personal point of view of the course I did in your branch in Madrid last month .
in addition , I would like to give you some suggestions I think it would be worth it to take it into account for the next course it will take place next year .
first , I would like to stand out the outstanding classmates there were in class .
they were not only really clever people but also excellent co - workers .
working collabor@@ atively is , in fact , the most interesting way of learning any subject even English .
second , the teachers were really good skills to teach .
they managed to encourage all of us every day .
this way we made the most of us and never gave up improving our English level .
third , phone@@ tic classes scheduled on Fridays came really in handy .
they helped me to pronounce words better than before starting the course .
however , in my opinion there should have been at least one native teacher in the teacher &apos;s team .
this way we had been able to hear a native speaker and I think it would have been worth practising .
to wrap up the report just say that on the whole the course was fantastic and I am looking forward to signing it again next year .
yours sincerely ,
Juan O@@ ro@@ z@@ co
I am keen on cinema thus I love to watch all types of films .
but , what films are in my Top 100 list ?
in my opinion , Ba@@ bel is a fascinating film with a dramatic and thrilling storyline that is a top 100 best movies .
I really enjoy it because the plot is original and it shows different life stories of moving characters .
in addition , I think that the settings are very realistic and the actors had a great performance .
therefore , I recommend that drama genre lovers watch Ba@@ bel as its message will move you .
it reveals that our feelings cross the boundaries of all cultures and we are connected to each other .
my name is Mohamed El - S@@ ham@@ oun .
I am 20 years old , living in Port - S@@ aid , Egypt .
I am a student in the 3rd year of the faculty of medicine Port - S@@ aid University .
my father works as a teacher and so does my mother .
I have one brother and one sister .
I have been doing Judo for the past 11 years with a lot of prizes .
my hobbies are travelling , reading stories and writing my thoughts .
I am interested in scientific research and analyzing information so I am taking a lot of courses and training in this field as I want to be one of the greatest researchers in the world in addition to becoming a member in World Health Organization ( WHO ) .
it is n&apos;t just a dream in my mind but I work hard to make this dream come true .
last two years , I worked in many places such as a pharmacy , a restaurant and the water purification company .
I believe that work is everything and experience can make miracles in our life so I chose this program as I want to learn and study , I want to know more and more .
in my childhood , my dream was to become an engineer but when I changed my career to medicine , I realized that Allah chose the best for me and for my personality .
when I work anything I feel that I have the world in my hand so I can do anything for people .
one of my goals in the life is to invent an effective drug for one the incurable like cancer , AIDS and he@@ pa@@ titis .
I asked myself many times what is the aim of our life ?
and what are the benefits of work and study ?
but if you see your world and realize it well , it will be deserved from everyone to work so hard and achieve their hopes .
I learnt from Research that you can do everything in anytime in addition a little tired can change the life for the better .
I like travelling and visiting new places in my country and my dream is travelling to all the countries in the world also , I attended a lot of conferences in my field so I think this program is a chance for experience which will help and inspire me for the community services and development my society as I hope to come back and teach others what I learn .
I am writing with reference to the post of job as a camp monitor that you require in summer .
I have seen your advert this morning and I am really interested in it .
although I am a young girl , I think I am a qualified person for the post .
I am a preschool teacher and I have experience looking after children from 3 to twelve years old . I consider myself quite patient and fun that in my opinion , they are two qualities highly necessary for this kind of job .
I am good too at working in a team .
I do not like to be or feel alone , this could be one of my great weakness .
I really love being with people all the time .
I do not think being young will be a problem .
instead I believe it is an advantage .
young people are usually hard - working and active person .
if you require any further information , please do not hesitate to contact me .
I enclose my curriculum vitae with my telephone number . I would be grateful if you could give me an interview at your earliest convenience .
I would be really appreciate it because I am looking forward to starting work .
is there a future for privately owned cars ?
to be honest , I am not sure .
although privately owned cars are more and more popular , and they are increasingly becoming a common asset even in developing countries , it is not likely that this means of transport can be the means of transport of the future .
most people today realize that in our cities and in our planet there ia an increasing problem of space and pollution .
carbon based fuels will not last forever .
I would say that most probably private care are not &quot; sustainable &quot; in the long term , and it will be necessary to rever@@ t to some sort of public transport .
the population growth forecast tells us that in the next 35 years the world population will grow of a stagg@@ ering 3 billions human beings .
I know that it is nice to dream a future of technological people flying around , each of them with its own private small helicopter .
but it is not going to happen .
I guess that in our future there are no helicopters , and not even cars .
States and local authorities will have to tackle the problem and provide the public with a better alternative . T
he price for independent transport will grow dramatically .
I reckon that that will change the habits of the public .
even though we will have to read the timetable and to learn again to be on time , the nice old train could become important again .
imagine this picture : the first class of this semester , students are yaw@@ ning and do not pay attention on the teacher ; while the teacher ask for the answer , students can not answer because they totally can not remember what they have studied in last semester .
students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying partly because of after the long vacation , students will not remember the knowledge they have learned , partly because of long vacation will let students used to have fun instead of study , and partly because of some difficult courses should be continually studying .
therefore , I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
more reasons and detail will be shed light on in the following paragraphs .
to begin with , there is a general consensus , students will forget the knowledge they have learned after a long break time .
for example , on history class , history teacher have to repeat teaching the history of North America before he start to teach the history of South America in the beginning of the semester .
it is very wasting time and not efficient .
next to go would be , students get used to relax by having no study and homework in the long vacation .
for example , when the semester start , students can not get away from the sunshine , beach , and travelling .
in the class , students will recall the joyful time they had instead paying attention on the teacher .
last but not least , some difficult courses should be continually studying rather than having long a break time .
for instance , learning English should be a daily education , if you have a long time without learning English , you could forget the vocabulary or the grammar .
in a nutshell , based on aforementioned , I totally I agree with the statement that students could receive a better , more efficient education if they spend 11 months a year studying .
my favourite sport is the soccer .
I enjoy this sport since I was a child , I always remember when my father and my brother teach me to play it .
my father was a professional soccer player so I think that I inherited this love for the soccer .
I played soccer in different teams in my neighborhood , school or university .
I always enjoy playing soccer because when I am in the playing field I forget all problems .
I like to speak with my team partners .
together we analyze the rival team and we choose a strategy to win the match .
when I play bad I feel nervous but my partners give me their un@@ conditional support .
that is priceless .
I know the health is very important so if you practise this sport there is a big probability that you are healthy .
so if you are starting this sport you have to do it because you really like it .
if you do n&apos;t like it there are many options to practise whatever sports .
the soccer is not a violent sport but sometimes it becomes .
in this way you have to be prepared for anything problem .
finally I advise that you enjoy playing this awesome sport .
on my vacation I went to New York .
I also went to the amazing Niagara Falls .
something that made me happy was to see my family .
on September 12@@ th@@ ,@@ 2014 I went to New York city .
in the fly I was very happy because I received a lot of food .
the flight was approximately five hours where I watch beautiful movies .
when I arrived my uncle was waiting for me and I gave him a big hug .
we went to long island because there he lives .
he have a really nice house and I was happy to see my little cousin &quot; Angel &quot; who looks just like me .
in New York I eat so much , I also went to the city that never sleeps , Manhattan .
my uncle had the awesome idea of going to Niagara Falls .
we went in car and it was about 8 hours long .
finally we arrived to Niagara Falls city that looks like a ghost place .
it does not have too much to do but there were the falls .
I was amazed of how huge were the falls .
they were incredible amazing and beautiful .
I take too much photos because you do nt visit places like that everyday .
something that made me very happy was to visit my family .
my uncle Juan lives in United States of America and I was very to hug him because I miss him a lot .
my cousin Angel was very happy to see me and me too , we are like siblings .
my aunt gave me a lot of presents because she say they do not see me frequently and many other part of my family .
in conclusion I have a perfect vacation where I saw new things , visit awesome places as Niagara Falls and Time Square , receiving a lot of presents and specially eat a lot delicious food .
most attending students to Universities are out of the city where they used to live , so , they need an accommodation to live through their study years .
most universities provide cheap accommodations such as , shared rooms and dormitories to their students to lower the living costs , where most students have low income .
other students who may have family financial support prefer to hire an apartments to live independently
sharing houses or rooms have many advantages such as , cheap , safe , close to the university , and learn how to share everything with others . saving money and time will be more Ob@@ vious in university dormitories because monthly payments will be less than four times than hiring an apartment , and because it will be closer to the university , saving money and time is more efficient by reducing transportation &apos;s costs
in spite all these benefits , I prefer@@ - if I can - to live in an apartment where the personality is very important for me .
many years ago , I shared a friend in a room for few months during a course outside my country , these days where I worst during my life , he was dirty , speaking loudly all time and did not share the budget of eating . living alone will grant me the freedom to live by the way that I choose and still friendly with all the others without exceed the privacy of my friends . this matter will not achieved when living in shared rooms .
they annoying me
although The federal government which is decided as a role of USA has many benefits according to reading passage , the lecturer believes that there is no perfect government .
the powerful of the feder@@ alism which has more liberty for the states to have their own policies according to their needs , is not always good for the lecture where it may create some conflicts between the states .
an example of that is the marriage of homosexual where some state admit this marriage , others do n&apos;t .
also , the reading passage declares that even the federal government let each state function independently , it still control on the main decisions .
this case causes some problems where the lecturer mentioned the failure of federal government to stop illegal immigration to USA through N@@ ev@@ ada desert .
also the control of the federal government is the reason why each of the state and the federal blame each other in the increase of the unemployment in some states
in conclusion , federal government which give freedom and powerful , cause many problems such as no single policy and confusion in the responsibility .
travelling to a different country can be both exciting and frustrating at the same time .
I think that any type of trip is exciting but also have their frustrating moments .
in order to enjoy travelling to Mexico I would give two important advice ; first try to get alone with travel companion and enjoy Mexican food instead to critic about spicy sav@@ or .
people say that in every voyage the people suffer to different moments of the trip : arrived , get away to the frustration of an unknown place , get alone with your trip companion , success as a traveler and arrived home trium@@ pha@@ l .
in order to enjoy a trip to Mexico I suggest that the traveler find a manner to get alone with his or her companion .
this minimal chance would make a big difference when you visit other city .
as an example , if you are able to get alone with your travel companion could enjoy each moment of the trip , exchange some pictures , eat together , and visit places with common interest such as museums or malls .
other advice that I would give to people coming to Mexico is that enjoy for Mexican food .
Mexican food has a lot of tasting dishes from different states of the country .
for example , there are a lot of American people that does n&apos;t like spicy food and also most of the times could get angry with the excess of pepper that the Mexican people used to use to prepare their food .
as advice I would suggest you to ask for sauc@@ es with lower pepper .
in this way the visitors would be able to enjoy Mexican food with less pepper and the same delicious sav@@ or that is so characteristic of our country .
in conclusion , I offered two important advice for visitors that coming to my country : try to get alone with their companion in order to have fun and try to enjoy Mexican food because it is delicious !
after the Internet was invented and revealed first time in August 29th 196@@ 9 , Social Media Site ( SMS ) is the next most significant innovation that has partly replaced for face to face communication .
SMS such as Facebook send out 700@@ .@@ 000 messages , and 17@@ 0.@@ 000 T@@ wee@@ ts are publici@@ zed on Twitter each 60 seconds .
un@@ surprisingly , social consequences of Facebook and Twitter plays an important role in communication , regardless of distance or time .
however , people who use Facebook , Twitter or SMS in general , are not likely to have their own personal privacy that there is a possibility of cycle of bullying .
this essay will force on benefits and disadvantages of Facebook and Twitter , and also comments potential future of these implications .
communicating can be achieved , regardless of distance , through Facebook and Twitter .
the benefit of being from being connected globally to Facebook and Twitter is that messages can be transmitted almost instantly to viewers .
firstly , Facebook and Twitter can be used when their users are in an unpleasant mood , and in where their negative feelings are expressed .
secondly , Facebook provides the opportunity to remain in touch with daily activities from friends , making observations of relationships , maintaining one &apos;s own feeling within the network ( through wall posts , po@@ kes , messages , etc ) ( O@@ ld@@ meadow , Qu@@ inn , &amp; K@@ ow@@ ert , 2013 ) .
that is to say , human behaviour on Facebook are inter@@ acted we with others by sharing their mood , and receiving responses .
Thirdly , Facebook can be used as an organizational communication tool in business .
knowledge about the members increases continually , and moreover , maintaining relations with other existing members , and also sharing their same interests by the social network .
( emer@@ ald Group Publishing , 2013 ) .
finally , people are allowed to follow anyone who they find enjoyable through Twitter .
for instance , by following famous celebrities , people can easily see every daily activities which are posted by them .
however , due to this , people who are being followed , or users in general , may have less personal privacy , and also there is a high potential of being purpos@@ ely aggressive toward someone .
however , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
however , information which is appeared on Facebook or Twitter are easily accessible , therefore everybody can easily response as a public opinion .
mostly Facebook users expect their friend to respond or pay attention on what they are doing .
in fact , along with agreeable and pleasant comments , there are also small amounts of aggressive and even racist comment .
first of all , people can post any racist comments which target a specific group or person .
for example , after the premier of The Hunger Game was released , a fan posted an onset racist tweet that saying that they were unhappy because one of the main actresses was performed by Black person ( R@@ au@@ ch and S@@ chan@@ z , 2013 ) .
because of the accessible information through SMS , it has led to many problems involve with cycle - bullying , cycle - bar@@ tering , cycle - stal@@ king behaviour ( Kri@@ sh@@ na , as cited in Williams &amp; Mer@@ ten , 2008 ) .
for example , Kri@@ sh@@ na et al@@ . (@@ 2013 ) reports a case of continuous disturbing a woman from a man called Mr .
X &quot; admitted to a state psychiatric hospital after being found not competent to stand trial on charges of stal@@ king harassment , tre@@ sp@@ assing and telephone harassment &quot; ( pp .
5@@ 76 . E@@ 1 - 5@@ 76 . E@@ 2 ) .
potentially , Facebook and Twitter , and SMS in general , may replace face to face communication and improve their functions , because people feel more freedom or enjoy using Facebook or Twitter without have to view each other appearances .
therefore , it would be easier to be connected and keep in touch with friends within a second , rather than have to call them .
the possibly outcomes might be the more time people spend on SMS , the less communicate skills that they have .
in addition , to decrease the risk of negative comments or posts , Facebook and Twitter would improve their futures to solve the less personal privacy problem .
for example , controlling what posts should be sent by adding more privacy options .
however , despite the useful of these implications , people should pay attention that Facebook and Twitter could affect their social life by avoid using it most of the time .
in conclusion , the benefits from using Facebook and Twitter is that people can communicate and being connected to their friends frequently .
also people can easily reduce their negative mood by sharing and expressing how they feel .
in contrast , because Facebook and Twitter have been connected worldwide , which means protecting personal privacy is probably impossible .
possibly , users might express aggressive toward each other , because of lack of privacy .
photography classes for everyone
introduction
teenagers are constantly influenced by social networks like Facebook , In@@ st@@ agram , P@@ interest , etc .
photographs are included in all of those sites .
also , this phenomenon of taking photographs is part of our daily life , because it is the best way to capture special moments like birthdays , travels , special occasions , etc .
as a new college subject
this practice is considered those activities that anyone can do without any kind of special preparation .
however , teaching students how to apply better techniques in the moment of taking a picture should be consider as learning to draw .
both skills are required in today &apos;s world and are necessary to be developed in the education system at the same level .
the reasons
recent studies show that in the last twenty years more than 3@@ ,000 photographs are taken per person in the world , especially in the latest generations lifes@@ (@@ teenagers and kids ) .
this increase is related with the overwhelming development of technologies in computers , cameras , cellphones , etc .
also , photography is considered as a type of art , so it requires the knowledge of espe@@ cial skills , techniques and knowledge .
what a lovely weather today !
what a wonderful day ! there is an April now and finally spring came .
a bright sun is shining , the snow melted away in March .
the first spring birds came back from the warm countries .
they are singing funny and building their nests .
people look happier .
they are feeling tired after a long snowy winter .
we set our clock forward one hour in March .
the summertime was first introduced in England in 19@@ 08 .
the days become longer and the nights get shorter and lighter .
we usually set our clock back an hour in October .
a lot of people are happy , because they can sleep ( for ) one hour more .
hockey as a life style
although all sports help you to have a healthy life , hockey provides you more than just being healthy or fit .
what are you thinking of whenever you choose a sport ?
you think that your life style will improve ?
well you are mistaken .
for doing different kind of sports you need to be skilled or willing to try new things .
what if you do n&apos;t have none of those requirements ?
then you know hockey is the answer .
hockey is a sport I have played for many years and it turned out to be my favorite .
it &apos;s a good way of learning how to communicate and work with people . in simple words ,
it &apos;s a team sport .
however it &apos;s not always as simple as it sounds .
you have to train five days a week and you need to concentrate a lot .
on the other hand I enjoy every second of it .
through all my life I have been willing to improve in this sport and since 2010 it has became a life style to me .
why will I recommend this to you ?
it would definitely help you to grow and improve as a person .
hockey will change the way you see the world and you are going to start seen it with other eyes .
so stop searching for the right sport , this one is for you !
as far as I &apos;m concerned , public transportation is the best transport media for environmental care .
in spite of some people make enough money to buy their own car , electric and hybrid cars are more expensive than traditional ones ( the ones who use gas or diesel ) so , people choose this ones and that &apos;s because pollution is several issue that we have to deal with .
the environmental care is taking strength every day , from kids too ancient people .
the government and many companies are measuring the CO2 emissions which are being produced by industrial or service processes that are necessary for producing goods for the social consume .
if people do n&apos;t use public transportation , they could walk , ride a bike or buy a traditional car , and that will probably take place when the destiny is far from the place where you live .
from my point of view , public transportation will be very important in the future , especially in developed countries .
I think the government will slow down the fee in public transportation , that could make people to use public transportation and caring the environment from CO2 emissions and prevent the global heating .
in Cos@@ l@@ ada City Council , people are well informed about taking care environment .
the city council has developed several campaigns to improve the awareness of its citizens , for example , the children learn at school how to separate the waste .
there are many ecological islands .
each of them has three or four kinds of bins and they are not as far as two hundred meters .
there have been several planting campaigns to plant trees and to clean the river J@@ ar@@ ama side .
Never@@ th@@ eness it is never enough , because dog &apos;s owners that they have most of the blame .
since 2008 , there are many bike paths across the city , so the citizens will be able to avoid the car and they will emit less air pollution .
the organic waste is picked up every day and plastic and paper waste is picked up every other day .
the most important thing in the environment care is the education of children .
our planet is in such a difficult situation that we have to take over the problem .
a problem which was caused by us , human beings , with their target of making money without thinking of the effects .
my family is very conscious of this trouble so we make any effort to solve it .
we usually use the public transport , which has a great quality in the city I live .
it works perfectly : it is always on time and the price is worth .
we live in a cottage and we have several bins which are classified according to the material we want to recycle .
moreover , we run an organization which pays people who bring us the materials to recycle .
the benefits are given to several organizations which take of care of the environment .
my sister teaches people what to do with things they want to rid of , such as bottles or papers .
she is able to do such beautiful jewellery that lots of people are following her !
it shows that this kind of things can have a second life .
as soon as the last river ends the southern border of Egypt is here .
the Ni@@ le river is the origin of the ancient Egyptian civilization that counts over 6 thousand years .
all histor@@ ians , researchers , scientists agree with this .
and as for me , I totally support their point of view .
Egypt is a kind of the river civilization among the huge desert Sa@@ hara .
all over the time the Ni@@ le is the only source of water for Egyptians .
furthermore , elev@@ ation of the water level on the river helps people to realize the possibility of expanding the area of fertile lands .
the Egyptians called their country &apos; Black Land &apos; to mark it off of the red soil of desert .
nowadays , deep and wide valley of the Ni@@ le became the most important transport line for Egypt .
through the centuries people have been exploring the nature of the Ni@@ le .
the ancient Egyptians divided the year for three seasons compared to dry or wet period .
they knew when it will be the &apos; Green Ni@@ le &apos; or &apos; Red Ni@@ le &apos; to stock up with clean water .
but such high level of development of Egyptian civilization has the negative side as well as positive .
the great amount of d@@ ams were built on the river that caused the disappearing of a lot of plants and animals .
anyway , a lot of Egyptians still living far from the main water ar@@ tery of the country and hardly can find the clean water to drink .
but I hope , as soon as Egypt become developing the government will pay attention to the ecological problems that high level .
when most people think about an important historical place in Italy , they think of Duomo , in Milano .
but the Duomo is not the most important .
I am sure you &apos;ll agree that it &apos;s the Colosseum .
for centuries this building had been the symbol of this city .
it quite ancient , but still fascinating for thousand of tourists , who come every year .
it was built in 79 A@@ .C. by Ti@@ to , who was the Roman emperor .
it was used for shows with animals or humans , who were killed without pity .
moreover navy wars were represented in order to celebrate Roman army .
it is ruined through the ages , but now people understand his importance and take care of it .
in my opinion it is important because it remembers our past and our traditions , which we should n&apos;t forget .
however not all people are aware of it .
it &apos;s our strength and every time I go beyond I realize how many people succeeded in building it .
that &apos;s why it is important : it makes us understand to never give up and follow our dreams .
in this fast moving world transport has become an important factor for everyday activities .
everybody needs a mode of transport to earn their daily living .
there is no point in saying public transport has no future .
travelling through car is a convenient mode of transport , but most of the population can not afford it .
there are advantages and disadvantages in using a public transport .
firstly to discuss the benefits of public transport it is cheap and affordable for all class of people in society .
variety of buses are released by the government in order to meet people &apos;s financial conditions .
using public transport is a time waste and no privacy are some of the disadvantages .
similarly travelling by car has its own advantage and disadvantages .
everybody can not afford a travel through car as it is costly , but to discuss the benefits , one can enjoy high privacy during travel and is convenient
and sophisticated and can travel faster .
to sum up with it is not appropriate to say that there is no future for public transport because both has equal advantage and disadvantages .
sometime I think that Taipei is too crowded .
there is no denying that the MRT in this city is such a convenient metropolitan system .
however , during the rush hour , there are always have such a ruin person who has no public awareness at all .
they occupy too many seats , including priority seats .
furthermore , most of them are students .
they do n&apos;t respect other passengers , just keep laughing and teasing each other , despite the fact that some people have told them not to do this .
moreover , I think that provide the seat to elders is also a problem .
priority seats , are preserved to those who need , not only elders but also some adult need it .
somehow , not all of them can you identify whether their bodies feel uncomfortable merely from their appearance , which lead to Some misunderstanding between them .
some people even blame them for they occupy the seats instead of offer the seat .
moreover , some old people would take this consideration action for granted and they would even command young adults or students offer their seat without manners !
in my opinion , the transportation in our city have nothing to criticize expect that .
everyone should develop the awareness of public manner .
television is an important part of modern culture .
we depend on television for entertainment , education , news and films
TV has much benefits :
firstly it enables young people to share cultural experiences with others .
TV can act as a catalyst to get kids reading - following up on TV programs by getting books on the same subjects or reading authors whose work was adapted for the programs .
television can teach kids important values and life lessons .
educational programming can develop young children &apos;s soci@@ alization and learning skills .
news , current events and historical programming can help make young people more aware of other cultures and people .
documentaries can help develop critical thinking about society and the world .
TV can help introduce youth to classic Hollywood films and foreign movies that they might not otherwise see .
cultural programming can open up the world of music and art for young people .
but television have also negative effects : first of all , children who spend a great deal of time watching television get less exercise .
in addition , these children receive less soci@@ alization with other children .
television also takes away from family time .
this is also true for families who eat in front of the television .
I deal with consulting and sales of financial products and services to an international bank , in the mass - market and small - business .
I follow the relationship with customers from acquisition to the advise until the realization of contracts , building and maintaining relationships after - sales in the aim of customer satisfaction
I also worked with large and small teams in back - offices , managed many administrative activities related to mortgage , personal loans , accoun@@ tability and investments too .
I worked for several years to the acquisition of new customers , to provide them with a complete service , from the account to insurance products , investment products , personal loans , revolving credit , and cross - selling products .
in many years of work I have hon@@ ed my skills in managing non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
non - standard situations , analyzing the problem , finding and implementing practical and easy solutions .
I have faced several situations always work with ser@@ en@@ ity and enthusiasm , I like to work in a multicultural and dynamic .
I &apos;m careful to meet the goals of the team in which I work , cooper@@ ating with colleagues to achieve the goals by providing my skills , always willing to learn , respecting other points of view together finding ways to deal .
I work for the same large company for 25 years , now is the time to change and find new job opportunities .
needs to work my husband has been living in Za@@ and@@ am , I want to find a new job in Holland to re@@ join our family .
I like sports such as skiing , riding and swimming . I &apos;ve also got the rescue licence , I worked as a lifeguard in the summer studying for the patent pad dive master
nowadays we all hope , that public transport can save the world .
when we see all this cars in our yards , when we stay in traffic jam , we think that one day we will have to live our car and use public transport .
if we do n&apos;t do it , one day we &apos;ll wake up in the im@@ mortal traffic jam .
but , probably , this situation is only period of development of transport .
we are told about a lot of innovations in this sphere .
for instance , Google reported about Goo@@ gle@@ mobile .
maybe , robots will be able to drive more smart then people .
if they will contact each other and use Goo@@ gle@@ map or something like that , they will be able to avoid accidents on the roads .
so people will be able to avoid traffic jams .
not all people like the idea of Goo@@ gle@@ mobile .
some people think , it might take away their independence .
but another of people think that it is not so bad idea , because they will be able to drink in spite of the fact , that they are drivers at the moment .
however , there will always be people who dislike to be a driver anyway .
and people who hate public transport , there will always be .
the question is , which sort of people have more impact in the world , and , finally , who will decide .
how many language do you speak ?
did you ever think of learning another foreign language ?
or do you want to be a poly@@ g@@ lot ?
today it is miles time important to learn a foreign language than before .
there are few reasons which show you why it is important to learn a foreign language today .
first , if you are planning to travel to another country , it is absolutely useful to speak local language , it makes your trip more easy and comfortable .
second , for finding a good job opportunity , the business exchange is increasing in the international level , if you speak a foreign language , certainly it adds some value on your profile and you can get a higher salary .
third , through learning a foreign language , you do n&apos;t only learn a language , at the time you are also getting know its culture , get to know a different culture and society different than yours &apos;s , it enri@@ ches your knowledge .
over these years , there are more and more miserable accidents happened around the world .
from newspapers , magazines , even foreign medium , we can easily figure out that our environment is changing severely .
many scientists infer that people &apos;s lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years because of humans &apos; greedy .
humans always desire to have a more convenient and comfortable life , but forget to protect and cherish the Earth at the same time .
high - technological countries have developed a great number of forests and lands to build high buildings .
various factories emit excessive carbon dioxide into the air .
all the examples above will enhance the temperature and make the Earth hotter and hotter .
the higher temperature enhance , the worst the living quality is .
if people around the world could n&apos;t put more emphasis on our living places , we must have a dark and hopeless future .
due to the climate change , the weather is so hot that people could even have a water shortage .
losing enough water supply , people &apos;s body will become weak and rough .
in this living situation , instead of laughter and happiness , there will be more fight , hatred and sadness .
everyone lives in despair , but can not find the entrance to brightness .
the terrible consequences , are caused by the humans &apos; unsatisfied heart .
friends , from now , let us be the members to protect and take care of our Earth !
it was dangerous , but I knew I had to do it .
the undercover work is very hard , not just because you will work with dangerous people , the really danger is if you get discovered .
when people know that they were deceived , that they trust were broken , heads will roll .
you have to be precise , fast , and a really good actor .
the passion for the cause is the key to survive .
it is just something that I had to do , not you , not her , me .
I did n&apos;t choose that , this job has chosen me .
dear Sir or Mad@@ am@@ me ,

in our modern world , many people are suffered from stress that spring from life conditions .
in addition to this , people are working in very stressful workplaces and they want to leave from this condition in holidays .
therefore , it can be said that holidays are the best option to renew the soul and revive the spirit for people .
in holidays , people can away from daily problems and also can take more time with their friends and family .
in this respect , many people prefer to go natural places with their families in order to forget about bad situations on their lives .
for example , walking in the seaside or swimming in the sea can be helpful to forget hard life conditions .
on the one hand , holidays are the best for people in terms of thinking clearly their experiences about life .
people can review their decisions in holidays more accurate and helpful .
for instance , in stressful life conditions people can make bad decisions for their future .
besides , people underestimate emotional feelings in their workplaces .
the reason is that people must complete their tasks in order to gain more money to maintain their lives and they forget about these emotional feelings such as love , helping people or thinking spiritual things .
it can be clearly seen that in holidays people are getting closer and they remember their feelings .
for example , people meet their relatives that never see for a long time .
at the same time , people have a chance to go sacred places in order to renew their spirits and souls .
they can pray for God and it gives a relief for people .
when people remember these emotional and spiritual subjects they can become more happy . because people need to leave the material world .
in holidays , people have time to review their mistakes that leads to stressful life .
in conclusion , holidays are very suitable for people in order to heal their problems and stressful life conditions .
also holidays are very helpful days in order to revive the spirit and the soul because people have a chance to move away modern life that has full of material subjects .
cycling to school , to work or to do any other activity it is not a common habit in Spain .
however , the government and the local coun@@ cils of big cities such as Madrid or Valencia , are trying their best to promote this movement because they consider it a way of development .
on the one hand , there are many benefits of cycling .
firstly , it reduces traffic jams , noise and pollution , as well as it lowers CO2 emissions .
furthermore , it turns out to be the quickest method of transport .
on the other hand , there are some issues such as the increase of danger on the roads .
stati@@ stically cycling is generally considered to be more dangerous than travelling by car .
another disadvantage is the weather .
getting wet when it rains , having to do a lot of effort to cycle into a strong wind , freezing weather or having to keep drinking when hot weather .
in my point of view , C@@ ycling contributes to improve community spirit and it is possible to look for solutions to face the disadvantages of this activity .
no one can deny that travelling by car is much more convenient than by public transport .
for example , people taking car do not need to spend time waiting for the bus or subway .
and this undesirable time might be not so short during holidays , due to less frequent schedule .
also , we can drive a car to any place where the public transport perhaps is not able not reach .
when the bus is crowded , we have to stand , making us more exhausting especially for a long distance .
even though cars could provide us with so many advantages mentioned above , advantages of travelling by public transport should not be neglected .
first , public transport is good for the environment compared to private car .
as we all know , the more public transport passengers use , the less car exhau@@ sts are emitted per person .
recently , several studies have shown evi@@ dences that there is a strong relation between car exhau@@ sts and lung cancers .
in other words , public transport plays an important role in protecting human beings from suffering of diseases and saving life .
second , public transport saves city spaces .
as more and more people choose to live in cities , nowadays our cities become larger and more crowded .
correspon@@ dingly , the space for each person becomes more limited than before .
provided that every citizen owns a car and use it rather than public transport for every travelling chance , I suppose that our streets would become a parking place and everyone would spend more time in congestion .
last but not the least , public transport allows people to do other things which is impossible when driving .
the drivers have to continuously pay attention to surroundings , resulting in a tense spirit .
for a passenger , however , travelling is a complete relax .
people can listen to music , take a phone call with a friend , read a fascinating book or just loo@@ t at outside .
though there are many advantages for public transport , it does not mean that public transport is the best choice for every situation .
e.g. , it offers less flexibility than cars , and is less environment friendly than bicycles .
therefore , it is unreasonable to conclude that one transport can replace others .
it is better that people are aware of their pros and cons and choose a fit one .
languages for the future
should learn other languages ? .
we live in a world that day to day changes and people need to develop their skills and overcome .
I think there are many reasons to learn languages .
on the one hand it could allow you to communicate with people , know different cultures and travel around the word without the language barrier .
also in recent years to express yourself in English , French , Germany and Russian has became something essential and very important in our lives to find a job .
I think a great disadvantage is the price of the course .
also I consider that it tends to be hard and takes time away from doing any other things .
it seems to me that young people should spend more time studying languages because it will be profitability in the future but to achieve it the will have to be motivated and to enjoy learning .

dear USA Summer camps ,
I am writing in response to your advertisement for a job .
I had a part - time job as baby - sitter and I take care of my 11 years old brother very often .
I worked in an Easter camp too and I have already prepared lot of activities , like &quot; r@@ appe@@ l &quot; , pain@@ tball ...
that is for these reasons I think I have the skills for the job .
I can be contacted for a meeting in the above address .
I hope you considerate me for the job , Rodri@@ go
today , I went to my Win@@ nie &apos;s home with Adriana in the afternoon .
we ate delicious food and play interesting games altogether .
we had a great time .
at 2 o&apos;clock in he afternoon , we arrived at Win@@ nie &apos;s home .
first , we listened to some songs , such as almost and big big world .
after thirty minutes , we had tea .
Win@@ nie loves eating very much so I can easily find much food at her home .
we had mou@@ th@@ - watering strawberry cakes and juicy apple juice for tea and they were extremely yummy .
after having tea , we play hide - and - seek altogether in Win@@ nie &apos;s garden .
Adriana and I hid behind a bench and Win@@ nie looked for us .
suddenly , Win@@ nie fell over a little stone .
Adriana and I immediately came to her and held her up . &apos;
your knee is bleeding .
are you ok@@ ay@@ &apos;@@ I asked .
I was shaking like a leaf and my heart is pounding since I was worried about Win@@ nie .
I had butterflies in my stomach@@ . &apos;@@ Yes , I am fine , &apos; Win@@ nie replied .
I felt relieved then .
then , Adriana found a pl@@ aster and put it on Win@@ nie &apos;s wound .
Win@@ nie felt warm inside and smiled happily .
I felt glad today although Win@@ nie hurt herself .
why ?
it is because our friendship is more rugged .
what an unforgettable day !
in my opinion the house in the future will be better .
house of the future will be big and bright .
inside will be full of conveniences .
big spaces will be divided in a few zones .
relaxation &apos;s , learning &apos;s , kitchen &apos;s zones and so on .
in house of the future there will be automatic curtains reacting to the light in every house .
television will be cor@@ dless , as this way as at present Internet .
every house will be flexible .
thanks to that it can expand or reduced .
everything depends on the number of people .
swimming is my favourite sport .
why do I like swimming ?
well , swimming has always been an Olympic sport , it is an individual sport so it depends entirely on the swimmer &apos;s efforts , but you can also enjoy teamwork when you participate in swimming competitions .
it is a sport that requires a lot of fitness , it is a sport that can be learnt at any age but children can start to learn swimming as early as two years of age .
swimming has different types ; dolphin , crawl , back@@ stroke and breast stroke .
swimming as a sport is very useful in weight reduction if you are obese and need to reduce your weight , it is also the best sport for the asth@@ matic patients because it strength@@ ens the chest muscles and decreases the vulnerability of those patients to respiratory infections .
if you will start to learn swimming , choose a place that has an experienced coach , and try to be part of a group of your age .
Hello Paul ,
I enjoyed helping at the concert which was in An@@ t@@ aya on October .
I had a great time with people who are working as a helper for the concert .
I got a lot of experience from them .
in the concert time all people can enjoy but nobody think about how they are preparing to concert .
I saw so many interesting things during the preparation time .
for example they know everything about each helper &apos;s jobs but on the same time they just concern own subjects .
I want explain to you some interesting part from my experience .
in the concert morning were excited and thinking about the concert and we decided do not think about the concert just do your job which would be given .
when we were arranging concert plan we made work sharing for all of us .
some of them started design the stage , some of them checking songs volume and lights .
my job was checking songs list which singers would perform .
I think it was the most difficult part of the concert because of singers .
they were always wanted to change some songs which was on the list .
on the concert time I was really worried that something would appear suddenly .
actually everybody can be worried because they gave time and effort for it .
finally concert started and all the lights were shining like stars .
it is difficult to explain that feeling .
when the concert finished I felt like a bird which flying freely .
of course I had some pain in my legs because all the time I was standing .
however , I like to be a volunteer on enjoyable projects .
I want to invite you to our next concert which will be next month if you have any time please come and see how we are preparing for the concert .
I am waiting for your email .
see you !
technology is changing the way we live in many ways and how we receive and use information is probably the most affected .
regarding advertisement , technology is having a huge , and not always positive impact on outdoor advertisement .
from black - and - white adds posted in public places we have moved to practically live surrounded by outdoor adds placed in every available and imag@@ inable spot .
from buildings with enormous and bright screens to interactive bus stop signs .
the recent developments in mobile technology allows adverti@@ sers to offer person@@ alized publicity to each of us .
I&apos;@@ &apos;m sure that in the very near future , if I have been looking for restaurants in M@@ all@@ or@@ ca in my computer or mobile at home , in my way to work the adds on the buses I will see - which of course will be screens and not printed paper - will show images of M@@ all@@ or@@ ca , or an add from trip advisor with M@@ all@@ or@@ ca in it .
it will suit me sometimes , and it even will be useful , but I &apos;m also sure sometimes I will find it aggressive .
the way it feels aggressive to enter a square or plaza in my town and find it full of bright screens , no matter how beautiful or artistic the pictures displayed are .
advertisement might be considered an art , or at least some pieces are really artistic , but placed on the wrong spot or showed at the wrong time they loose they artistic side .
but , technology is here for best or worst , and we have to learn to deal with it the best we can .
if I could change one thing in my life , I would like to change my house .
I &apos;d like to have a big detached house in suburb of Ar@@ te@@ m or Vla@@ div@@ osto@@ k .
so that I could live more freely and independently .
if I had this house , I would decorate it in modern stall .
I would build there fitness gym , wardrobe -@@ room , swimming pool .
if I had such house , I would like to equip a barbecue area in my garden .
I could invite my friends and relatives .
together we could spend time in pleasant atmosphere .
when it comes to my favorite sport , tennis will always be my answer .
though I am a beginner of it , I think it &apos;s interesting since it requires a lot of skills to be a master of it , which sounds very challenging .
when I feel stressed off , I always play tennis to release my pressure .
if you are a beginner of tennis , my advice is that you need to get a suitable rocket for you first .
as the proverb goes : if you want to learn something well , you would need to get the right tools first to work on it .
next , you are required to learn every basic skills step by step .
since tennis requires lots of basic skills , if you do n&apos;t learn these important technical slowly and steadily , you may get hurt during the practice .
finally , finding a good teacher is is also critical .
a skilled coach can teach you the best skills of tennis .
do we have better television than a few decades ago ?
do we have enough choices in the screen ?
can you imagine having only two channels and not playing the whole day ?
that was only 30 years ago .
an explosion of channels arrived to our houses in the eigh@@ ties .
in this report we will see some characteristics of today &apos;s television .
number of Ch@@ ann@@ els are gradually reducing
in our country one decade ago when digital TV arrived , a lot of new channels flouri@@ shed .
all TV tried to get several lic@@ ences to distribute their shows .
in order to resolve some defic@@ its budgets , today there are mainly two TV groups .
less channels means less choices .
internet TV is increasing
it costs less money and you can choose exactly the moment , where and with who watching this or that television program .
you just follow a suggestion made bay someone .
you just click on it .
they have to reduce their budget
despite of changing channels we see the same news .
big Broad@@ cast groups are used by all of them .
it is expensive to keep journalists and camera all around the world .
it is cheaper to buy it .
summary
TV is dying .
it is hard to compete with the Internet .
nowadays only national or international broadcast groups can be in the match .
perhaps political reasons help to maintain such a budget deficit .
however the fact is that there is a countdown on them .
dear Mrs Hop@@ kins ,
I have seen your advertisement in the newspaper and I am writing to express an interest
to join your small group on a trip around the world .
I am a 20@@ -year - old student from Switzerland speaking German , French and English and I am keen on travelling .
with several trips to many countries I have made until now , I would say that I have already some experience in travelling around the word .
I am interested in to join your group , because I like meeting new people from other countries and I would like to explore new countries around the world .
for ten years I have been in a scout group in which I have learnt a lot about different kinds to find a way or to ori@@ ent@@ ate myself in the wilderness .
furthermore I feel suitable to join your group because I like travelling and I would like to be a part of your adventure .
I look forward to hearing from you .
dear Steve ,
it was good to hear from you .
basically my idea is to use this trip to learn as much as possible , I mean , not only the English language but also to know more about your culture and visit nice places of your country as well .
as I told you before I ca n&apos;t afford to pay this trip alone , so my father will put up some money to help me .
but I wanna find a job to help him with the bills .
can you give me a hand on it ?
you can also help me to find a cheap place to rent .
it will be helpful if you find a small apartment near the Cambridge University where I &apos;ll study English for 5 months .
thanks for all your help and I look forward to hearing from you .
best wishes
Jo@@ ão Mat@@ os
Hi John ,
I am looking forward to seeing you .
first of all , you should get outside of the airport terminal .
there you will see bus stations in the street .
when you get there take the bus which has number 1@@ 11 .
then ride to the bus stop &quot; Z@@ li@@ č@@ ín &quot; .
there you can get to the underground station and travel to the centre of Prague .
if you choose this way , I &apos;ll call you in the morning to tell you where will we meet exactly .
but if I were you I would take a taxi for the underground is quite boring , but it is cheaper .
anyway , you need to get to the centre . I &apos;ll wait for you there .
finally , the weather forecast for next month looks pleasantly as it is usual at this time of year .
that &apos;s why you do n&apos;t have to take warm clothes .
I am delighted to see you soon .
best wishes ,
Jacob
in my opinion we should go to the restaurant because all people need a relaxing moment for doing work better than before .
firstly , we can discuss type of food we want to eat .
actually , students eat a lot fast food while they are studying at university , because they do n&apos;t have time to do food , for these reasons I think that the best restaurant is somewhere when they do home - made food , and a good idea is for main@@ s course : baked potatoes , steamed vegetables and for dessert apple cake .
on the other hand , we are studying architecture maybe we should choose a special restaurant , I like a charming and comfortable restaurant with a lot of windows , with a white chair , table and wall , more or less a relaxing environment but the atmosphere is very important for dinner and I think that we must vote this , because we will have a good night or not depending the type of atmosphere we choose .
in conclusion , I think that this type of food and atmosphere is very for us , because normally we had spoken about book , work and studies , while with this type of environment we can speak about us , our family , our hobbies and all people get to know new something about other mates .
I would like to go to F@@ oster &apos;s Hollywood .
I love the food here and I think my classmates too .
you can it the best burgers you have ever eaten .
they are incredibly delicious .
I do not know how do they make and cook them .
these burgers are my favourite food because they are amazing .
I can not say how they are because you have to taste them .
it is a flavour similar to stay in the heaven or in the paradise .
I recommend you to go to this restaurant and you definitely leave with a very good flavour in your mouth and a huge smile in your face .
you will want to come another time .
however , if you do not like burgers you can eat whatever you want of American food and you will get the same fantastic opinion as a person who has eaten another meal .
public transport plays an important role in our modern day lives .
more than a billion people use buses , taxi &apos;s and trains etc as tourists , for work , meeting relatives , going to school etc .
many even use cars .
though travelling by car is more convenient but it is expensive .
that is why because the cost of petrol , diesel and gas is quite high in most of the countries of the world .
while travelling by public transport can save a lot of money in following ways :
1 . people can save the money they spend on petrol .
2 .
as they have specific routes across the country , town , city and villages , it helps people to spend less in shops or restaurants on highways or even inside the city etc .
I disagree with the statement stated above because in future we are likely to have only two classes in society , the rich and the poor .
middle class is disappearing and becoming scarce day by day .
it is because of high taxes on goods .
so , I believe either we will have public transport or people are going to be as they were in the stone age .
public transport is even good for our environment rather than cars .
nowadays people have different views about reading books and watching movies .
some of them think that books are more interesting than them film versions .
I agree with this point of view .
I tend to think that there is nothing better than reading a book .
firstly , reading helps to become a well E@@ duc@@ ated Person and give a chance to develop knowledge .
that &apos;s why while you are reading you are getting a piece of information .
furthermore , books develops imagination of reader .
when you are reading a picture of what is happening appears in your mind .
you can imagine how heroes look Like , you can imagine different views , where the action takes place .
and finally , I think it &apos;s very important that you can easily take your book with you and start reading anytime you want .
on the other hand , if you like being in company the best way for you is movies .
because you can watch it with your friends .
also many people choose movies because they like sound@@ tracks and special effects .
it &apos;s so exciting .
but all these factors are not important for me .
I suppose that books are better than them film version .
to sum up , I &apos;d like to say reading is really great thing .
a girl was walking home one day .
she was with her mum ..
she was just a young beautiful girl !
so , they were going home when the girl noticed a cute doll in a shop .
she had blond hair and she was wearing a blue dress , white gloves and black shoes .
just like her ... &apos;@@ &apos;@@ Mum I love this doll ! could you bye it for me ? &apos;&apos; she said .
her mum could n&apos;t deny to her , so she bought it .
Oh ! the girl had so many special moments with her doll@@ ! ! they looked so adorable together ! they were like twins !
after some years the girl decided that she had to move .
she was eighteen years old , she had to be independent .
so she took a deep breath and put her doll in the at@@ tic just like her childhood memories .
at night she heard some creepy noises from there ...
she went there and there was the doll with a knife in her hand@@ . &apos;@@ &apos;@@ Bell , why you do n&apos;t play with me anymore ? are you boring of me ? just because I have only one eye ? but you removed me the other one .
just because I do n&apos;t have one if my gloves ? but you did it again@@ ! &apos;@@ &apos;@@ she screamed .
and then ...
next day , going at her home her mum wanted to find her daughter .
so , she went upstairs ...
the girl had a knife in her neck and on the wall there was a sent@@ ence@@ ,@@ &apos;@@ &apos;@@ Why did you leave me that way ? &apos;&apos;
tennis is an individual sport .
just you have to deal with the game .
you can choose lots of places to play .
you need a good pair of shoes , a tennis racket and some balls and person who play with .
although you should be good at playing backhand or forehand , you can lose finally .
this sport is not just about a physical power .
you supposed to use your brain as well .
it is combination of a physical power , a technique and a mental power .
as the other sports , tennis is getting more modern , fast and commercial .
I mean professional tennis .
some children wanted to play tennis because of money or glory .
some of them practise tennis because of their parents .
it is not fair enough .
children should play games , not just tennis , because it is fun , it develops their skills , helps to physical health and so on .
you can start if you are grown up anyway .
it is never too late .
either you can find a professional coach or just join your friends .
enjoy !

essay
in today &apos;s essay I am going to focus on the pros and cons of studying English abroad .
is it really worth leaving your own country for a period of time to study English ?
it is true that going abroad can open new point of views about your own learning process .
talking with English native speakers is always a good thing because you will be able to judge how well or badly you are doing .
besides , it can be funny and enjoyable if you plan it properly .
however , you will have to spend a considerable amount of money in it and you will not be assured to achieve your goals at all so it would be able to become a real nightmare if you are not focus on your learning tasks .
from my point of view I think the advantages overcome the disadvantages especially if you have some money saved for it .
but if you do not , there is always a solution which is using the Internet to learn everything you need .
you can even talk with native speakers by using some Ch@@ at Ro@@ oms online such as ski@@ pe and others .
football , a passion
when I was little I had tried a lot of sports , Hand@@ ball , Swimming , Tennis , but my favourite sport is not one of those , it is a sport that I have never imagine : football .
all my life I thought that football was a sport which was for men , not for girls , but once I tried it , I loved it .
have you ever think about playing football ?
at first , when I started to play football I did it with my classmates , who where all boys , so I used to feel a little bit uncomfortable , however , some years ago , they started to integrate me when they play , and nowadays , I love playing football with them .
now , some women and I started to organize female matches , so I am more used to play with girls . I never imagine that I was going to be so keen on football , but now it takes part of my life .
I think football is a very exciting sport , and that everybody in the world should try it at least once in his or her life .
one thing you should keep in mind if you want to play football is that you have to be ready to creative some pun@@ ches .
I recommend you a great restaurant which is in the shopping center .
I have been there twice , and I like it .
its name is &quot; The English oven &quot; , and it &apos;s a fantastic traditional and modern restaurant with British food .
the service is excellent and the waiters are so pleasant and gentle .
the interior is big , so all the class could stay inside without problems .
the decoration is modern and cozy , and it &apos;s got some great traditional British objects .
the food is one of the best things in the restaurant that is always tasty and fresh .
the &apos;ve got a lot of different dishes , traditional and modern .
they have also got a lot of different types of salads , pasta and pizzas .
the desserts are very good too .
they &apos;ve got original ones , like sweet pizza , and traditional .
there is a big variety of ice creams .
this restaurant is not too expensive , which is perfect for us , because we do n&apos;t want to spend too much money .
the restaurant is in the shopping center , so we can get there by bus or by train .
I think this is the best restaurant to go on the end of the course , so we could book some tables as soon as possible because a lot of people usually goes there .
during whole life , famous people , such as politicians and film stars , media are accompanying them .
in my view , public person deserve to have their own life , without photograph@@ ing .
in one hand , becoming a public person associate with journalist , mass - media , fla@@ shes .
famous people are obligated to provide their life in exem@@ pl@@ ary way .
however , they still being ordinary people , they make mistakes .
people are thought being jealous .
notice any kind of failures .
it seems to me that journalist might be absolutely toxic and they have defective influence on society which assess celebrity through the pri@@ sm of journali@@ stic documentary .
in the other hand many of stars sold their privacy to earn more and more money .
the value of their talent , abilities are counted in amount of tabloids scandals .
summing up , all over the world , are living famous people who do n&apos;t bring into the li@@ me@@ light their life .
it has ever been very useful for a long time ago , nevertheless nowadays , there are some people who ask if the public transport was sup@@ pressed , and society would save a lot of money .
however , people should think about the large advantages , such as : people save money ; it is very comfortable and good for the environment .
firstly , the main reason is the cost because the people who do not have a car they need to travel or commute to another place and a car is very expensive .
the cars need to be repaired ; besides , if you have a car , you have to pay some taxes .
in addition , these people need to have public transport for travelling around the country and city .
secondly , another reason is the global warming because the atmosphere is much polluted .
if you use the public transport , you can be less contaminating than before because there are a lot of people who travel together in only one transport .
finally , the last reason is the comfort because you have a car ; it is so difficult to find a car park in the centre of the city .
besides in some cities , car can not be parked in some places , such as : the old city and the city centre .
summing up , people are aware of global warming and think about the high cost of having a car .
from my point of view , I get used to walking around my city and my car is just used if I travel around the country .
we are living in a ever changing world .
today &apos;s new things become things of past in few months .
take an example of mobile technology , your latest hand@@ set , with latest configur@@ ations becomes outdated within few months after buying it .
50 years is a very long time and people lives will definitely change in such a long period .
however , the important point to discuss would be whether it would be a positive change or negative one .
last 50 years science and technology took great leaps , internet , mobiles made us more connected .
today , we have all the information at finger - tips .
today , we do n&apos;t need to worry about getting lost at new place , Google maps are always there to help .
we need not to cram English words today , as we can quickly find meaning of any word on our mobiles .
meeting new people or selling your products , you do nt need to face anyone , everything can be managed through a virtual platforms .
today our lives have become much more comfortable than past , thanks to progress mankind has made in technology .
on the other hand a number of terrorism , global warming and greed became top challenges of today &apos;s world .
climate changes due to global warming causing natural disasters now and then .
terrorist activities causing ha@@ vo@@ c in public live .
corruption and greed of people in power making it difficult to trust people leaders .
if these challenges are not addressed in coming years , imagining better lives for people in 50 years hence is rather difficult .
we need to remember technology is just a tool , in right hand it would be bo@@ on for us , in wrong hands it has power to destroy the world as we see it today .
to who may concern ,
I &apos;m an Italian girl who &apos;s studying to improve her English . I &apos;ve got a positive and energetic personality .
I read your advertisement on your website and I immediately thought &quot; That &apos;s for me , I &apos;m the right person for this kind of job ! &quot; .
perhaps , you &apos;re wondering why I should be the right person .
that &apos;s soon said .
I &apos;m motivated , flexible and open minded person and I had a lot of experience in this field as well .
I &apos;ve worked as social trainer and as educators since I was 16 .
I love doing social activities and planning events .
when I worked as educ@@ ator , I used to plan and manage some sports and outdoor activities .
I had a very great memories of these experiences and I would really like to live them again .
if you are interested , please have a look at my CV .
as you requested , I attach it in this mail .
best regards .
personally , mobile phones are very important in my life .
I need that device near me because I have three children and I want to know how and where they are .
the same about my parents ; they are old and sometimes they call me for talk about their health .
concerning video - games , I agree with scientists that they thought its help children &apos;s brain to develop , but is important controller them because there are a lot violent games .
however there are brilliant games for children .
in my opinion , the Internet is absolutely a revolution in current society .
it is very common to use the Internet in my work for research or Google information and also connect wh@@ it other teachers , speak about courses and change information .
finally , I think technological developments make us improve to the future .
friends should be like a shadow always beside you .
in the time of joy and sorrow .
nothing is impossible in life but not doubt it is not easy to find sincere friends .
it does not mean you will never find one .
it is very important to interact and socialise with people to make a friend .
the more people you will meet the more easy it will become for you to find a friend .
when you find one spend time with them , share views , ideas and go out with them .
friends do not have to agree on everything you say but they should share their views about it .
the Gu@@ ardi@@ an is a British daily newspaper which includes national and international news .
you could find a variety of articles such as politics , Business and Money , sports , culture , education , Life and style , Trav@@ els , the weather and the Environment .
there are plenty of advertisements for jobs and donations to help individuals .
readers are able to express their opinion freely .
they use a quality English language which avoids slang language .
as result , it is suitable for students who learn English Language to improve their English .
on the other hand , I realised there were two disadvantages .
for example , it is not suitable for children due to official Language . there were also a huge number of commercials advertisements which make the readers bored .
overall , The Gu@@ ardi@@ an is considered one of the best newspapers in the world .
nowadays , in the modern and progressive world where people are smart and economy very highly developed .
some people think that we need in tablet computers instead books
in my opinion , the problem is very interesting .
sometimes then I am watching TV or I am reading newspaper I notice that gadgets become very useful for our life . it seems to me good opportunities to make our life more easily .
also it makes us more clever .
I am convinced that using tablet computers in our everyday life is rather good .
people do not need to carry a lot of books in a bag . pupil could not say that he left a book because he has all books in his tablet computers
some people think that it is a bed idea .
they believe that it is useless thing for our generation .
such people are sure that electronic things make us stupid .
they insist on not using tablets at school .
personally for me , I like books very much . when I at home I use books because I like to smell and to touch the paper of books .
I do not agree with the people who think that tablets are useless .
we should use it but we are must not forget about books .
in conclusion , I want to say that that we should keep ab@@ re@@ ast of new technologies and try to make our lives easier
the Big Mi@@ stake
this day was full of joy and happiness , but something went wrong after when she told him that she is pregnant .
she was so happy about this news and she thought that he will be happy as well , but ...
at the moment when she told him that she is pregnant , he just frozen .
it was too much for him .
he thought it &apos;s easier to walk away and avoid this conversation with her .
he tried to understand what &apos;s going on with him .
it was weird how many questions and doubts came up on his head .
one part of him was really happy , because to be a father is his one of the biggest dream , but on the other hand he could n&apos;t handle this news .
this woman , who stands next to him , is his girlfriend , his future wife .
he should be happy and hug her and celebrate this good news .
but somehow he did n&apos;t feel anything .
all that he felt was anxiety .
he could n&apos;t handle the feeling , when she tried to touch him , to kiss and hug him .
he knew that she loves him as much as he loves her , but everything was just too wrong on this moment .
her voice , her smile and even her body was to wrong on this moment .
she could n&apos;t understand what &apos;s going on , because it was just three weeks ago when they had a conversation about kids and family and he said that he would like to have kids with her .
and now , he just avoids her and he is not happy about the news .
it was a big mess .
she was more than happy and he could n&apos;t handle this news .
they both knew that they love each other and they care about each other , but it was too much for him .
he stood up and said to her girlfriend that he needs a break and he have to be alone .
Michael closed the door and knew at that moment he had made a mistake .
to the beginning I am going to take about what is my lovely sports and why I will enjoy the sport .
in fact , I do not like to do some sports during the anytime , but if I really need do some exercises that I like to go to swim in the swimming pool .
firstly , I think , swimming pool is clearing .
such as after swimming that I have a safe and a bathroom to take shower .
secondly , I do not like to go to beach , this is because I do not like big sun and sand .
third , swimming in the ocean is most dangerous .
however , I like to stay in the swimming pool during the summer .
actually , I do not know how to swim but it is my favorite sport in my whole life .
moreover , I think before any kind of sports that we should do some exercises that is because we need to relax our bodies first . if we do not do it that we will get dangerous while we are doing any sports .
in conclusion , my opinion is I do not like to do any sports but we need to choose one kind of sport in our life and almost all people need to do it , as we could not stay at home or working all the time .
even you really do not like to do exercise that you can go to shop .
the purpose of this report is to outline the most important actions which have been taken in our town to protect the environment as the main issue to improve our quality of life .
in the first place , we need to pay attention to the fact that Caceres is located in a past@@ ure area where local farmers have been breeding sheep , cows and pigs for centuries in spite of the hard weather conditions such as high temperatures and terrible drought in summer .
as a result , our water resources are difficult to be preserved and it is clearly necessary to maintain active campaigns to raise people &apos;s awareness about the importance of a rational use of it .
the local government is also taking strong action on creating green areas in different places in or around the town where citizens can spend their free time or even do sports .
that &apos;s the reason why it has been working on the recovery of some areas which are now parks or recreational areas .
finally , the town has also improved the management and treatment of waste system with the active cooperation of most of the citizenship who is really concerned about the recycling of waste need .
in fact , around 90% of Caceres inhabitants are said to sort and recycle their rubbish taking it out to the yellow , green and blue containers in every street .
and that is the negative point , these dump@@ sters are too visible in town and it would be advisable to change the ones we have for underground ones .
I woke up today and I just remember that I was doing a presentation about landscapes , and the ones that do it will reward a bonus point but anyways this is n&apos;t important information .
I searched my family in the house and there was no one in the home , just me .
I get a bit scared so I search them outside in the streets .
I did n&apos;t knew that a bomb hit on the city and killed almost everyone , now I have to find my parents .
I think the reason why I did n&apos;t know about the explosion is because this part where I live is a very poor area and it &apos;s not that beautiful so you ca n&apos;t distinguish were does the explosion hit .
finally in some days I found some neighbors with some food , I was starving to death so I ate a lot .
we made some incentives about laws , but it was a total conflict , because the group noticed that some food was missing somehow .
I think that someone dr@@ ags some of the food on the night while everybody is sleeping .
so everybody is gon na try to enforce the laws .
in the next morning I ate a piece of steak and the group was talking about some creatures that were walking around to kill and eat us .
in the night I was thinking about many things just when I heard some noises .
I stal@@ ked him and it seemed that this guy has a hum@@ p .
I stom@@ p him and when he turned around it was a woman from the group .
we were talking about this when a dog just came near ; it was adorable just when he converted into a big weird creature .
he bit my leg and it hurt a lot , we tried to alert the others but it was too late , it was the group or us .
we saw that beast eating our friends and the food .
in some ways that she robbed the food in the night and I wake up it was good for my survival .
but if I had the opportunity to reverse the trend of how am I going I would not do it because I have to face all of this .
doing EX@@ CER@@ C@@ IS@@ E IS GOOD FOR you@@ re HE@@ AL@@ TH
why do you have to exercise ?
what benefits do you obtain while exercising ?
do you know that 75% of people in Mexico , does n&apos;t practice any type of exercise , this is a big problem to our society and is the problem number 1 of why Mexico is the country with more obese in the world .
doing exercise it &apos;s an important thing to do in a healthy and happy life , while you exercise you feel well with you re self an you re body .
there &apos;s a lot of benefits that come in hand with doing exercise like reducing or take control of you re weight , it helps you with heart disease , problems with you re body , and also you can make a lot of friends while doing any exercise .
now days there &apos;s a lot of different types of exercising , you can practice any sport , like soccer , basketball , baseball , or you can simply go to the G@@ Y@@ M or practise C@@ ros@@ s@@ fit or something like that .
soccer it &apos;s a great sport where you can make a lot of friends , you can stay fit , but you also need some skills because it &apos;s not easy to control the ball and dri@@ bble you &apos;re ri@@ vals on the field .
I recommend you to practise any sport you like and enjoy every second you spend exercising .
thanks and start now , you wo n&apos;t regret it .
is there any future to public transport , for travelling by car is much more convenient ?
many disagree about the public transport whom are to be disappearing , though we still have to deal with different opinions about increasing in travelling .
this composition will explain the two different opinions .
firstly , the car is more convenient because there is privacy .
also , unlike public transport such as buses and underground , you have much more comfort and speed .
there is a perception that a car can give you the freedom of choice .
on the website of The Scottish Government ( publication &quot; Young people and transport &quot; ) , a 12 - 14 years old boy explain « - I prefer going in the car , it &apos;s quicker ...
there &apos;s not as many people around you ... I prefer the car because you can listen to music as well . »
although they are many positive points about private cars , they are also negative ones .
indeed , cars increases the pollution , you have traffic congestion , and it is very expensive . « - On my wage , even the driving lessons are expensive .
then just owning a car and looking after your car , insurance , tax , etc .
obviously it would benefit me if I worked in Edinburgh , but I do n&apos;t work in Edinburgh .
» says a 17 - 22 years old boy .
now , secondly , travelling by public transport is cheaper ( we do n&apos;t pay any fees on public transport , but also , it is safer ,
according to The Saig@@ on Times , there are a lot of traffic accidents which occurred to private cars .
the main reason is that the cars &apos; owners are drunk when driving .
it is clear that if they took a bus or a taxi when they were drank , it would not have as much accidents .
finally , many developed countries on the world , such as England , America , Canada , Japan and so on , have built a public transport system , so the traffic jam have been decreased .
as a result , the economy has been increasing .
from this analysis , it is obvious that travelling by public transport is very important .
topic :
do you agree or disagree &quot; Al@@ ways telling the truth is considered the most important thing in a relationship &quot; ?
disagreement on always telling the truth be the most important point in a relationship will be my opinion .
even though being tru@@ thful is crucial in relationship , always telling the truth would be considered as hurting others &apos; feelings and is unwise .
another reason for not telling the truth all the time is if it is about personal matter and it would feel like awkward to mention to colleagues or the employer .
it is better to tell a little white lie at this moment .
to further illustrate the first point above , could hurt one &apos;s feelings by telling the truth at all time .
for example , if some woman you are acquainted wearing inappropriate clothes not fitting in the occasion .
people usually tend not telling her the truth since it could make her feelings .
instead of doing so , people may praise her with other things on her .
in that case , they could still make conver@@ sions without boiling her mood .
the other point is when it comes to personal matters , people usually intend to keep it private since most of the time it is strange and inappropriate to talk oneself too much to people at work or even people that one just got acquainted .
if there are questions about things one do not want other people to know , they might say a little white lie which usually does not matter too much .
if I was having a day off to go to a doctor , I would prefer other people from asking details about it by say that I just had some err@@ ands to run .
these are the two opinions of mine on telling the truth or not .
last Friday , Michael and I was in the school playing happily with each other in the classroom .
when we were in the class , suddenly Michael walked towards the door .
Michael closed the door and knew at the moment he made a mistake .
due to this , we@@ &apos;re both called to meet the headmaster .
I could n&apos;t understood why we needed to meet the headmaster just because Michael had closed the door .
the door was n&apos;t broke into pieces or fell down .
my curiosity had put me into a big trouble .
I asked the headmaster in a polite way and hopefully he can gave me the answer I wanted .
however , things do n&apos;t happened like what I hoped .
I ended getting exp@@ elled from the school because teacher and the classmates suspected Michael and I steal our classmate - Sally &apos;s wallet .
I could n&apos;t imagine the teacher and friends also pointed at us firmly and without given any chance for us to speak out .
I finally realised that everything was a trap and we &apos;re the unlucky and innocent ones as we fell into the trap .
we wiped off our tears , and waved our hands when we left the school .
although , one day later the headmaster found out the truth through CCTV , but we refused to return to the school and decided to change a new school as we know even if we go back this time , similar cases could happen next time .
this is because the teacher has a biased mindset .

day number 8 .
we were ready to go and find the others , we went outside the shelter we built and write in wall near to the shelter &quot; safe zone &quot; and if there is someone that needs supplies he would find some supplies and am@@ mo to survive .
we start our journey and going in the forest , there was a lot of # pests on our way there were various guys that were sick we could n&apos;t do anything except for , keep going , I was seeing my little group to # diminish and some of us were # allergic to some plants , I was the only one that had no problem with all the other stuff people had problems with .
I thought that maybe my # genes were actually immune to the infection I could actually be the # revolutionary guy that helps everyone that was in my # skep@@ tic and I was really positive about it but # not@@ withstanding , I would n&apos;t actually sacrifice myself I have to think about is it help the entire world or just save a group the decision was in my hands it was # conventional to help the entire world but I do n&apos;t want to die . while I was thinking about that we found a body it was a familiar body from someone that was in the group one of those guys we wanted to find and alive not dead his face was all rotten and eaten away by the wal@@ kers .
we needed to find the ones that were still alive or at least tells us what happened to everyone , the # battle against hunger started everyone was hungry and we have n&apos;t eaten anything in a few days and that could lead us to two things dead or eaten away by a wal@@ ker so we needed to find something that was a # nutritional based food where we could eat with no problem and be ok .
we found a pharmacy and a restroom where we could get a rest and take a shower to clean ourselves .
we got close to the pharmacy there was no wal@@ kers inside so we run into the pharmacy and closed all the doors and I got someone to check us in the night I needed some rest and went to sleep immediately .
in my area there are many railway lines and they &apos;re often overcrowded .
but private traffic in this town is yet more present , as the result that Turin is the town of Fi@@ at , the well known factory .
near to your home , there are many supermarkets in which you can easily buy all that you need to live .
when you have to pay the telephone and energy bills , you can do that in any tobacco shops near to your home .
if you like shopping , in the peri@@ meter of the town , there are some big supermarkets , which hold many items of the main great factories of Europe and above .
like all the industri@@ alised countries , a connection to the Internet is granted almost for each area and each building .
at the end , the taxi are present and they cover all the town , but this service is less organised and developed than the English one .
there is an opinion that famous people , such as celebrities , film stars , politicians or people who work in music industry deserve to have a private life , deserve not to be under constant observation .
to my mind there should be a board between paparazzi work and a privacy of famous people .
in my opinion big stars should be able to relax and take some private time .
as far as I &apos;m concerned there is no one who feels comfortable when is under surveillance of people who wait to take pictures which shows them in embarrassing situation .
unfortunately , this is a part of cele@@ b &apos;s &apos; work &apos; so they have to take into account .
but on the other hand , there should be some in@@ viol@@ ability spheres of life without journalists following them all the time .
this rarely fragments of life without an eye of a camera should be an opportunity to live like normal , not famous people .
I know that catching celebrity doing cleaning or taking a dog for a walk is a shocking news for people who read tabloids .
to my mind , they do not believe cele@@ bs are such a normal people as everyone of us only with more money in theirs bank accounts
so , as you can see I agree with the statement that famous people , who are recognizable , deserve to have a private life and the ability of having normal life should be also given to them .
the Maze Runner
I recently watched this new film based on one of the books of this worldwide known author .
as I have an interest in thrillers , I decided to give it a try .
the poster of the film already offered a sense of intrigue and mystery which made me take the decision to watch this film .
the film starts by putting yourself in the flesh of the main character , which is a 16@@ -year - old boy who finds himself imprisoned in a cage and being transported to what it seems to be a camp .
he has no idea how he ended up there .
however , he soon realizes that this is not a normal camp , which is located next to a giant and mysterious maze .
the people who lives in the camp take up different roles in order to survive and defend themselves from the men@@ aces of the maze .
he took the role of a runner , the people responsible for exploring the maze and look for an exit of this place .
still , they only have the daylight time to explore the maze , as when the sun goes down it becomes very dangerous .
the film keeps getting better and better as you watch it , having its exciting moments when the characters discover something that hidden inside the maze .
I heartily recommend it to anyone who wants to have a rush of adrenaline while enjoying a solid story which will leave no one indifferent .
I &apos;ve been playing volleyball for 12 years now and hopefully many more , what I love about it is first of all that tall or small , anyone could play it as long as they &apos;re determined so basically is a life long sport for everyone .
I love the speed of volleyball , most of the time it &apos;s quick and if you blink you probably missed something , each contact happens in less than a second , and still every player direc@@ ts the location of the ball in that amount of time and then there &apos;s the intensity , if you have n&apos;t seen a game go until 32 - 30 , and see the energy on the floor and hear the noise from the crowd you &apos;re missing out .
personally winning such a set makes me feel like I could do anything , but when I do n&apos;t , it still keeps me wanting more .
I am always trying to jump higher , hit harder , pass and set better , and serve in more different ways .
I live in New El@@ tham .
my area is very clean and very green .
people there are very friendly and helpful .
it is a good place to live .
one time per week on Wednesday , rubbish are taken .
of course garbage is sorted into different bins .
that is very good idea , because that rubbish undergo a recycling .
all my neighbors in the same way collected garbage .
every body care about cleanliness in the front of the house and in the garden .
especially spring is a lot of colours and pleasant od@@ ors .
new El@@ tham have beautiful parks where you can relax from the busy place .
green time in my town is really fantastic .
I have recently eaten at Black Bear restaurant , a typical Sic@@ ilian restaurant in Tre@@ cast@@ ag@@ ni , a little town near Catania located under the E@@ t@@ na volcano slopes , and I found that restaurant was easily the best I have eaten in .
there were two rooms , smoking room or non - smoking room .
the surroundings were rustic , yet it still felt airy and cosy , the waiters were very friendly and informative .
as I was eaten with my friend Mor@@ eno and his father , I managed to sample a good range of items on the menu and I really liked Chi@@ an@@ ina beef , it was very tasty .
all the ingredients were clearly fresh and of the highest quality .
the price was n&apos;t reasonable at all , because the meal came to about forty euros per person , so this restaurant it &apos;s a little expensive .
but I would highly recommend this restaurant despite the fact that the meal was a little expensive and I will no doubt be back for other dinners .
drugs is a topic with a lot of controversy .
they have been present in our societies since ever .
cann@@ ab@@ is , hero@@ in , speed are some examples of substances that are really well - known for all of us .
leg@@ alization of drugs is a very used argument by people who believe that this measure could solve the problem of the excl@@ usion .
Mar@@ g@@ ination has a link with the il@@ leg@@ ality of this activity .
also this il@@ leg@@ ality is the guilty for the attraction of the drugs because the majority of people start having drugs because they are young and its prohi@@ bition is very stimulating .
the real problem comes when this entertainment become in an addiction that can destroy our lives .
I think everyone has proved some kind of illegal drug to have fun , enjoy friends or just to prove them , and I do not believe that behaviour is wrong because everyone needs to experiment and try new things .
but we have to be responsible and have very clear that it is only something exceptional and not our daily life because it is very dangerous as some people are not able to put deadlines to themselves .
finally , leg@@ alization of drugs means that they could be tax@@ able and we know how the taxes work in our country so I do not know if it is a good idea or not .
Hi Sh@@ roo@@ q ,
that sounds great , I &apos;m so happy to hear that you are coming to Saudi Arabia , I &apos;m gon na be able to see you after a long time .
but unluckily , I &apos;m having an exam on Thursday so I ca n&apos;t meet you but you can take me from the school at 1@@ :30 then we can go to have lunch .
my school is really easy to find , go straight ahead onto Al@@ j@@ ame@@ ah street then turn right beside the far@@ ce of k@@ au university , after getting down from the bridge you &apos;ll find the school on your right .
so excited to see you !
bye for now .

dear Les ,
firstly , Spain is a great place for holidays in summer .
in that time , it is always sunny and , depending on the region , it could rain .
if you want to see some beautiful scenery , you must go to Barcelona where you will be able to see La Sagrada Familia , which was built by Anton@@ i Gaudi , or La Al@@ am@@ bra in Granada , which is one of the Seven Won@@ ders of the World .
in Madrid you can go to visit some museums , like the Re@@ ina Sof@@ ía or El P@@ rado .
on the other hand , if you want to see some wildlife , you must visit Cab@@ ar@@ cen@@ os National Park in Cant@@ abria , what is like a little safari , or Do@@ ñ@@ ana National Park , which in that period you can see some migration birds .
if I were you and I had a completely summer to enjoy Spain , I would stay one week in each place , and I rent a car in order to move between the cities .
I recommend you not to take warm clothes .
I hope you enjoy your summer .

B@@ art Simp@@ son is my favourite fictional character on TV .
he is the eldest son of the Simp@@ son family .
B@@ art is ten years old and is a typical American child .
he has yellow skin and big eyes , he is blond and has got spi@@ ky hair .
B@@ art always wears a red T - shirt and blue shorts .
the most important thing for B@@ art is to be the most popular student in his school , for this reason he is always mis@@ behaving .
his parents and the school principal often punish him .
B@@ art is energetic and clever student but he is also a bad student and he hates ner@@ ds .
although he is rather naughty , he has actually a heart of gold because he helps his sister when she needs him .
in the Simp@@ son family all the characters are very funny .
a lot of magazines say The Simpsons is the best cartoon series in history and I absolutely agree .
for me , B@@ art is funnier than Homer , although most magazines say that Homer is the best character
it was one dre@@ ary rainy Sunday morning .
I was n&apos;t in the mood to go out anyway .
everything suggested that I wo n&apos;t get out of the house for quite a while .
suddenly , there was a heavy knock on the door .
who on Earth could that be ?
who would have even bothered to pay me a visit during this bloody awful weather ?
my concerns were answered swiftly , for the man on my thre@@ shold yelled : &quot; I have a letter for Mr. Sam@@ son !
&quot; I was quite surprised , to be honest , I had n&apos;t received a letter for months .
I opened it and quickly scanned the text .
at first , I had observed the letter cau@@ ti@@ ously , but then I noticed my uncle &apos;s name in it .
although , I had n&apos;t met him a single time , this letter was his last will and I learned that I inherited a good deal of money .
fifty thousand pounds , to be precise .
Ex@@ ul@@ tation se@@ ized my mind instantly , but I soon began to worry : &quot; what will I do with this amount of money ? &quot;
well , the task I have chosen is about the town where I have been staying for last ten years .
actually , this town is located in the middle of hills and a river without water .
I am very much worried about the town where I am staying because everybody of this town is not bother about rubbish things they do every day .
first of all they are very dirty by nature .
they are very casual with the environment and the importance of cleanliness .
so called people of good nature are inactive and talkative and gossip of others not doing anything for the betterment of their own town .
all the household nearby the public road throws the dirty things easily and even do n&apos;t bother about the order of the municipality .
I see all these during my morning walk .
what I feel is that everyone who are staying the town should at least keep clean their own front places and sides surrounds them .
I am upset about it and whenever I get a chance I speak with my fellow people and look for their feedback but they are also the same in nature .
people are now self - centr@@ ed and very narrow minded .
though they are becoming so called educated but in real sense they are still sav@@ age .
dear Mrs. Ashby ,
yesterday I was in Green Pepper Cafe for a meal with colleagues and I have seen the advertisement for a job at weekends in your cafe .
I am very interested in this work and believe that my employment background is appropriate for it .
I am a Tourism student and I need to work at weekends to pay my studies .
I have worked one year in London as waiter in Hard Rock Cafe and 6 months as waiter also in Bar@@ com@@ i &apos;s Cafe in Berlin .
so I have experience in service , costum@@ er care and working long hours .
I Know how to prepare different kinds of food : sandwiches , fish and fries , hamburgers , Italian pasta , etc
I am also very good at dealing with people , I have never had a complaint sheet !
I have total availability at weekends and also in summer .
I speak Spanish , English and German .
please , find attached a copy of my CV , which expands on my experience and achievements .
I am looking forward to talking with you about the possibility of working in this position .
I am available to do an interview when it is convenient for you .
thank you for your time and consideration .
yours Sincerely ,
Mar@@ ía Lu@@ isa Cast@@ an@@ eda del Ac@@ una
nowadays , public transport has become a major topic .
the idea of leaving public transportation aside is widely supported in developed countries , but this idea is rejected in developing countries , like the one I live in .
as a matter of fact , car ownership have increased over the last decades reducing the amount of people using public transport .
the possibility of travelling in their own cars is much more convenient than going by a bus full of people or even worse , the idea of wasting time in a long queue .
nevertheless , you have another side to this reality .
there are people who can not afford to have their own cars or maybe they can afford to travel by any other means of transportation than the ones provided by the local government .
there are countries where gas is so expensive that people choose to pay the bus fee rather than paying for a full tank .
similarly , people in countries with less income turn to these services because it is a way to reduce their overall expenses .
to conclude , the future of public transport will depend on the usage people give it .
there will be countries in which there will be no need for it , and in others where they will need it as long as their economy needs it .
people need easy , fast and cheap solutions .
in general , using a car is easier then taking a train or a bus .
it &apos;s just near your house or your office .
you do n&apos;t have to go to a station by walking , carrying weights , or suffering because of the rain or the snow .
but if you are sleepy , tired , bored , or simply you do n&apos;t like to drive , you can find easier to take a public transport .
and also more enjoyable : you can relax listening to the music and looking around , or reading newspapers and books .
is the car faster then public transport ?
it depends .
the traffic can affect cars and buses at the same level .
sometimes cars are faster then buses , sometimes buses are faster .
speed trains are always faster then cars .
speaking about money ? travelling by car seems cheaper than public transport .
but , if we consider all the expenses ( buying the car , paying the insurance , etc . ) , maybe cars are not so cheap .
in fact , in every aspect there are pros and cons .
what about the environment and the quality of life in the cities ?
public transport is absolutely better .
so , even if travelling by car can be more convenient at a personal level , public transport has to be preferred by good citizens and strongly supported by governments .
informal letter for CAE ( PAR@@ T 1 )
dear Jan ,
thank you for your letter .
I am delighted to hear you are thinking about working in the summer .
from my experience working at the International company that organises music festivals , I can assure you that it will be of great use to you .
I am not sure , however that this job will meet all your requirements . .
in my case , the only opportunity I got for such activity was on the 22nd of July , when they allowed for a relaxing day at the festival .
happily you will get the chance to practise your English skills .
in my case , I had to translate a good amount of texts , and also help English tourists to get around .
though if you are looking for additional work experience you will probably be disappointed .
all I was asked to do in the rest of the time was to take phone calls and make coffee for tourists .
all in all , the experience was beneficial .
I made plenty of money , so I would n&apos;t worry about having enough for a nice holiday if I were you .
when you decide what to do , do not hesitate to let me know !
take care of yourself ,
F@@ avi@@ us
the past few weeks have been really tough for Michael .
this whole business started to get on his nerves .
he has to deal with it , the sooner the better .
for now one thing is clear as day - the one he is in love with is M@@ ali@@ ka , not Angelina .
the one he dates is Angelina , not M@@ ali@@ ka , that &apos;s the problem .
he ca n&apos;t dump Ang@@ y just like that , they &apos;ve been friends for years .
she &apos;s not bad .
and he has to put stop to this without hurting anybody .
so yes , the decision is made .
he &apos;ll break up with her .
probably , even tomorrow .
it all started in such an idi@@ otic way .
the door of his room was opened , he came out of the bathroom with just a towel around his waist and Angelina happened to pop in to borrow a lighter or matches or something to light up a cigarette .
Mike ca n&apos;t really say why they ended up having sex - perhaps , at the time he was pissed at himself for not having balls to get the girl he loved because of all these religious issues , M@@ ali@@ ka &apos;s family and so on , but this is what happened .
and that definitely was not the right thing to do .
at the moment he did n&apos;t realise that .
only after , when Angelina left , Michael closed the door and there he knew he had made a huge mistake .
dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing to apply for the post of a summer camp counsel@@ lor currently advertised on your website .
at the moment I have passed the second year of secondary school and I am waiting for the beginning of my final year .
I hope I will get valuable experience by doing this job , which will be very useful in the future .
I speak English , German and Polish and as a coun@@ ci@@ ll@@ or it is very handy .
I am very used to dealing with young people as last year I worked at a scout camp .
moreover , I used to work as a volunteer when still in primary school - once a week I would go to a local club to help children with their homework .
I am hardworking , reliable and well - organised and I can take control of difficult situations . I am talented when it comes to entertaining people , which might come in very useful in my role as a summer camp counsel@@ lor .
I am also an accomplished sportswoman - I am a strong swimmer and a qualified lifeguard .
I attach a reference from Tom@@ as@@ z Ja@@ wor@@ ska , who was my boss at the scout camp .
I would appreciate an opportunity to discuss my suit@@ ability for this post in an interview .
I look forward to hearing from you .
yours faithfully ,
XYZ
well , I would like to talk about my school life .
I &apos;m seventeen years old and I &apos;m an electronics &apos; student from Italy , in the north .
I wish to be a great engineer one day so I &apos;ve decided to continue my studies at university .
I &apos;m good at school , my marks could prove it ; I have worked hard since the beginning of the school year .
these days I started studying English in particular because it is the most important language in the world , so I need to know it well if I want to communicate with other people from other countries .
school is my life : I study about seven hours a day , especially maths and electronics that are the subjects that I like more .
my teachers are very good at their job so I hope to be like them one day .
the big problem in my class are the majority of my classmates : they are hopeful at school and they waste time doing nothing at school and I think even at home .
the thing that more annoys me is that they copy all the time from me and the other good students .
however , I do n&apos;t hate them at all ; they are very funny and kind people when they want .
coming back to my dream , I would like to carry on with my studies in London , at the Imperial college .
I hope to be at a good English level because next year I am going to take the intermediate certificate of English and then I am going to try enter at this school even if I know that it &apos;s very difficult ; the Imperial college of London is one of the most important universities in the whole world .
Puer@@ quit@@ our : a great experience to your mouth .
nowadays it is difficult to find people who enjoy the food as much as I do , because the calories , the kilos they are going to gain and all that stuff .
I arrived at Mexico City one month ago and I met an old friend from high school , Vic@@ ente .
we discovered our fascination with food and &apos; The Puer@@ quit@@ our &apos; was born .
then a brainstorm about meals and places to visit began .
the first day started in an important date … T@@ aco Day !
T@@ acon@@ ten@@ to was the place we choose and we really enjoyed al@@ am@@ bre al pastor and grilled onions , accompanied by cold beers .
due to Puer@@ quit@@ our is something to share , the second day we shared it with Diana , one of my friends from Vancouver .
again we ate tacos , but this time they were special .
the name of the place is T@@ ac@@ os La Chu@@ le and tacos are gourmet there .
it means that they have different taste of torti@@ llas -@@ vanilla , strawberry , Chi@@ pot@@ le , op@@ al , and wal@@ nut , among other@@ s@@ - and salsa -@@ tam@@ ar@@ ind , gu@@ ava , mango , gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole , etc .
that day did not finish with the tacos , after a walk in Re@@ form@@ a and a long pause in The Independence Angel we went to movie theatre to watch the art movie Ren@@ oir while we ate crepe .
third day was one of my favourite , the place is sooo nice and the decoration and even the at@@ tire of the waitresses makes you feel into the 50s .
LA Papa Gu@@ ap@@ a , which is located in La Con@@ des@@ a , offers baked potatoes with name of famous women and lovely drinks .
totally recommended !
Mar azul resturant , in the north of Mexico City , was the allocation for the fourth day of Puer@@ quit@@ our .
seafood is delicious there , my recommendations are bread@@ ed shrimp , fish fillet and shrimp Al P@@ ast@@ or and coconut water .
fifth day , it was time to eat more tacos , the place ? … El sad@@ der Hid@@ al@@ gu@@ ense .
you have to be starving to eat a mon@@ os@@ ul@@ cate by yourself , it is just too much for one person , so if you did not take breakfast it is a good option or you can share it with an amazing company as I did .
do n&apos;t forget to ask for a litter of beer .
almost a week in the Puer@@ quit@@ our .
the sixth day was to celebrate Magda &apos;s final test , a friend from high school , who already presented it to get the Master Degree ; and the farewell of Vic@@ ente , who is already at the USA , and that I will go to the UK .
because we like the food , we celebrated eating in Mem@@ el@@ as Pu@@ b .
you ca n&apos;t go there and do n&apos;t eat mel@@ as , that is like ear@@ ache but bigger and very delicious .
the dessert ?
ice cream in Te@@ po@@ z@@ ni@@ eves .
because V@@ IC was almost with a foot in the USA , we spent all day together .
seventh day started with a really nice breakfast , gourmet sandwiches and rose petal tea .
then we went to a book fair and visited some bookstores downtown .
the plan was to dinner at Hil@@ aria G@@ ast@@ ro@@ bar for all the good comments about it , but that day it was closed ; so we decided to eat at El Hu@@ equi@@ to the traditional Al P@@ ast@@ or Special accompanied by black beer .
the last day of The Puer@@ quit@@ our was accomplished with my favourite dessert , a strawberry cheesecake at Starbucks and a long talk about nothing and everything .
I love to spend time doing what I like and with people I love .
do n&apos;t forget to practise and enjoy Puer@@ quit@@ our ! ! !
these first two chapters extracted from Great Ex@@ pec@@ tations by Charles Dickens introduce a young boy known as Pi@@ p .
this kid has been raised by his sister , a person who mistre@@ ats Pi@@ p and his own husband .
sadly , Pi@@ p has no fortune in any possible way .
moreover , he is just a regular kid with a terrible life .
beside this , Pi@@ p seems to be a shy and intelligent kid .
he does not use complex words when he talks , but he uses them when he narr@@ ates .
also , his life would be perfect to create a dark comedy based on the undesirable life of a kid who only feels comfortable when he visits the tomb@@ stones of his parents .
obviously , nobody would like to live his life , but I think everyone would tend to feel sadness reading these chapters and , finally , like him .
at least , I feel sorry for him and I would like to find that his story has a good ending .
he looks like a good boy that lives in hell and the Devil is his sister .
nevertheless , the narrator is the truly protagonist and the way to tell the actions is the reason why the story can connect with the reader .
actually , the narrator is our protagonist , but telling the story as an adult .
and the author does not try to describe the protagonist with words , but with actions .
the narrator did not use any description of the protagonist apart from his name .
also , the narrator mainly uses direct speech , but he only uses indirect speech in just a few occasions referring to his own words .
this exception can be read at the end of the first chapter , where the narrator answer the thief writing that he said that he would get him the file , and that he would get him what broken bits of food he could , and he would come to the thief at the B@@ atter@@ y .
apart from this , he just writes exactly what the characters said .
the voice is in first person and uses a subjective point of view .
he only knows what he sees and he thinks about it , but he does not have any omni@@ sci@@ ent power .
however , his power could be analyzing and describing the situations with a rich vocabulary and in a refle@@ xi@@ ve way too .
also , he describes his parents in a hilarious way , imaging his father as a square , st@@ out , dark man , with curly black hair just looking at their tomb@@ stone .
these twisted and creative thoughts are spread all over the text , accompanied by even more twisted reflections like at the end of the first chapters , when he describes the man who stole him as man afraid of the dead bodies in the graveyard just because he saw him hugging himself .
beside this , the characters of the novel seem to be unhappy , living a sad and boring life that pushes them to abuse our protagonist , with the exception of Joe .
the narrator does not make an effort to describe psychologically the other characters , he focuses on their appearance .
actually , we only know that Mrs. Joe tries to make her husband and hers brother suffer and she is worries more about what their neighbors think about her rather than worrying about the person who live in his own house .
the narrator describes her as woman that has earned a good reputation being aggressive with his little brother .
and we know that Joe is a good man because the protagonist describes him as a mild , good - nat@@ ured , sweet - tempered , easy - going and foolish , but that is all we know about them .
also , the way the characters talk is opposed to the way the narrator writes .
in fact , the dialogues of each character are not longer than more than two sentences , with the only exception of the thief that talks about his partner in twelve long sentences with complex structures .
this kind of structure is widely used by the narrator , but the characters usually talk with short and simple sentences .
for instance , here is an extract of the narrator at the beginning of the second chapter :
&quot; my sister , Mrs. Joe Gar@@ gery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbours because she had brought me up &quot; by hand . &quot;
having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gar@@ gery and I were both brought up by hand . &quot;
on the other hand , the dialogues are simple and shorter :
&quot; now looked here , &quot; he said , &quot; the question being whether you &apos;re to be let to live . you know
what a file is ? &quot;
&quot; yes , sir . &quot;
&quot; and you know what wit@@ less is ? &quot;
&quot; yes , sir . &quot;
moreover , the vocabulary used by the narrator is opposed to what the characters said .
Pi@@ p uses a rich vocabulary , using a lot of mental verbs and abstract concepts that are usually inspired by concrete things .
the mar@@ sh pointed on the first chapter is good example .
regardless , the dialogues are written exactly as they were said .
the thief said &quot; Who d&apos;@@ ye with ? &quot;
this is written as it is said , making it more realistic .
not@@ withstanding , the way this novel is narr@@ ated is the protagonist .
the events are narr@@ ated in a mysterious way , telling us what happened in a realistic story - line without flash@@ back .
the story is narr@@ ated as it happens .
the second chapter makes reference to the first and reveals something about the thief .
also , the slow rhythm is adequate .
the narrator reveals not so much about him or the other characters , but he writes about the essential things we should know through the text .
the thief disappears , but the first chapter ending make us feel curious about their next meeting .
therefore , I do not know how the story will end .
too much mystery and just a few facts can be read in these chapters .
all I know is that this story will not have a happy ending .
probably , the thief will take Pi@@ p to an unwanted adventure that will make him growing up faster .
I would like to read a story where Pi@@ p ends as he starts , at the graveyard .
like another brick in the wall , another tomb@@ stone in the graveyard .
I would like to read a story without tale , just a regular man who died while he was learning to live .
obviously , this would be difficult as the narrator voice clearly comes from a person who lives while he is writing .
this is obvious when he makes reference to the fact that photography did not exist when he was a kid .
consequently , reading these chapters is a pleasure , but it is difficult to tell what is going to happen or , what is more , what the author is trying to transmit .
if the story has a happy ending , then the central theme could be getting over adver@@ si@@ ties ; if not , it is a sad story .
Anna knew that it was going to be a very special day for her .
she has been waiting so long for this day to come .
it was the day when she was going to meet her biological mother .
she knew she was adopted since she was 7 years old because her parents told her about it .
she did not feel bad about it because she loves her parents very much and she feels loved by them .
after her 18th birthday , Anna felt a sudden necessity of knowing what happened to her biological mother and why did she gave Anna away .
after finding the adoption papers she contacted the adoption agency .
she convinced the lady at the agency to give her the name of the biological mother of &quot; her little sister who had a disease and needed to know if her biological mother would be a match for a kidney transplant &quot; .
even though it was illegal , the lady gave her the name and the contact phone number of Sara fi@@ elding , her biological mother .
a month passed by before she had the courage to dial that number .
she hesitated several times because she was afraid of her mother &apos;s rejection .
after a few seconds , a woman picked up the phone .
at the beginning Anna did not say anything , she could not utter any sound .
but then she said &quot; hello , my name is Anna and I think you are my mother &quot; .
after another few seconds of silence , Anna heard her mother crying and asking lots of questions .
they agreed to meet the next day in the park .
she was going to have so many answers to so many questions .
Anna will be able to finally close an important chapter in her life and that is why she knew that it was going to be a very special day .
the most exciting day of my life .
last summer I went on holiday in Sar@@ de@@ g@@ na , in Italy , with my family .
on the first day I was very angry because my parents did n&apos;t take with us Il@@ aria , my best friend .
but I changed my mind when I heard at the radio that Feli@@ x Sand@@ man , a Swedish singer , was on Holiday in Sar@@ de@@ g@@ na near my hotel !
I love him and my dream was to meet him , but I knew it was impossible and my parents did n&apos;t want to drive me to his hotel , so I was quite sad .
unexpectedly , the third day , while I was swimming in the sea , I saw some people in the distance and some cameras , but at the moment I thought they were making a video .
then , I realised the boy at the centre was n&apos;t a simple boy , He was Feli@@ x !
so I went toward the crowd and when he saw me he smiled .
I was really exciting !
then I went to him and he took a photo with me .
he stayed there a few hours and I spent the best day of my life , asking him some questions and singing his songs .
when he left I was sad but also really happy .
this was certainly the most exciting day of my life .
L@@ &apos;@@ Alber@@ o , the Best Pizza West of Italy
one of my favourite restaurants that I am always hungry for is L@@ &apos;@@ Alber@@ o pizz@@ eria , located in the Hu@@ el@@ in neighbourhood .
as you enter the restaurant you know the pizza is going to be good .
the walls are covered with tr@@ ophies and photographs for the worlds best pizza .
the space is family friendly , a perfect place to celebrate a birthday or meet friends .
my only complaint is there are too many delicious choices on the menu , it is often difficult deciding what to order .
so far I have never been disappointed .
to start , you must try the Rose Wind Sal@@ ad , it &apos;s a fresh , flav@@ or@@ ful salad that is served in a bowl made of pizza crust .
as a main dish , you ca n&apos;t go wrong ordering one of their pizza &apos;s , all are made fresh to order in their authentic Italian pizza oven .
besides the great atmosphere and the delicious eat , the service is friendly and efficient .
the staff is very helpful explaining the menu to customers .
also the prices are incredibly cheap , it &apos;s around 12 euros per person for two different dishes , drinks and desert .
I completely recommend this terrific restaurant to anyone who is passionate about great food for an even better value .
I promise you wo n&apos;t be disappointed .
the best places for young people in Dublin
this report looks at the best places to visit in Dublin for young people from a different country .
it is based on a survey of the young people from Wh@@ ite@@ hall College as well as my own opinion as a permanent resident in the area .
it seems that the majority of those surve@@ yed are of the opinion that the best place to visit for young people would be Temple Bar .
it offers a wide variety of activities like museums , a cinema , a very large green garden and many pubs to choose from .
the John@@ nie Fox Pu@@ b was highly recommended , it offers an opportunity to listen to traditional music , watch dancers perform and enjoy a nice meal in one place .
the O@@ de@@ on cinema offers a multiple choice of movies in 2D and 3D and a discount for students on Wednesdays .
the Dublin Wa@@ x Museum was suggested by many students .
several people said that National Bot@@ anic Garden is the best place for students to meet and spend time outdoors .
on the whole there are activities to take part in and many places to visit depending on students preferences and finances available to them .
it is true that people everywhere like watching sports .
sports starts being admired by youth and can im@@ print a model of behavior on the young &apos;s minds .
in this essay both sides of the position stated above will be analyzed before my own perspective is provided .
from one point of view , top athletes are good models to emul@@ ate for several reasons .
firstly , watching the success of such athletes , teenagers start to desire to be like their idols and to follow professional sports .
this means they will want to play sports , which is essential for their health .
secondly , doing sports also teaches priceless life lessons , such as discipline and dealing with success and failure .
the importance of working hard to achieve goals and practicing regularly to become good at something are also demonstrated by professional sportsmen .
this is a good example for youngsters to follow .
from another perspective , sometimes professional athletes are not good role models .
firstly , sport has become business .
many sports stars are only concerned about money and fame .
this can lead adolescents to believe that money and fame are an important part of sports instead of learning how to play well and having the fun of the game or the competition .
secondly , there are those athletes who behave disgu@@ st@@ ingly .
for example , some take drugs or cheat in order to win at any cost .
it goes without saying , that this kind of behavior sends a wrong message to the young .
in conclusion , there are a number of advantages and disadvantages in regard to professional sportsmen as good role models for young people .
on balance , I am inclined to believe that professional athletes can be excellent role models for the youth , as long as they represent the positive aspects of playing sports .
Dickens and the Bronte sisters use the same style : realistic style .
they are influenced by the surrounding in which they live : Dickens the city of London while the Bronte sisters the natural landscape of the Yor@@ k@@ shire .
Dickens and Charlotte Bronte often use the first person narrator or the point of view of the protagonist of the story .
their realism is different : in fact Dickens &apos; style is that of sentimental realism in which he mixes pathos and comedy , like characters that tend to be car@@ ic@@ atures of the vices and virtues he wish to portray , while the Bronte sisters use realistic style l@@ ac@@ ed with Romantic and Gothic elements , like Byr@@ onic male heroes and female protagonists that are psychologically complex .
the graph illustrates the four different sources of consumption of fish and other meat in European country from 1979 to 2004 .
of the given source , the overall fish and meat consumption ranked from nearly 60 grams per person per week to roughly 230 grams per person per week .
from the 4 source ate , 3 of them remained a steady decline with the exception of chicken consumption which had risen over the 25 year period .
only fish consumption showed little change during the period , beginning and ending at approximately the same the level of 52 grams per person per week .
both lamb consumption and the category la@@ bell@@ ed beef had a decline trend between 1979 and 2004 , although maintained a decrease overall , with lamb consumption falling from a peak of 150 grams per person per week in 1979 down to just over 50 grams per person per week in 2004 and beef consumption falling from around 230 grams per person per week down to just over 120 grams per person per week .
chicken consumption was the only source of meat consumption which elabor@@ ated stable climbing from 150 grams per person per week to the highest consumption 250 per person per week .
overall , it is evident from the graph that some sectors declined , others rose and one remained steady consumption over the 25 year span .
dear Mr. Mer@@ ri@@ field :
my name is D@@ mit@@ ry Lav@@ ro@@ v .
I &apos;m a post@@ doctoral in Russian Cancer Research Center .
our lab works along with Alex@@ is Her@@ vi@@ eu@@ x on his study of ard@@ in .
recently he has visited Moscow and while we &apos;ve been having conversation I &apos;ve mentioned that I was looking for the opportunity to work on post doc position abroad .
and since my great interest is to develop my skills in micros@@ copy and digital image analysis while working in the field of cell biology Alex@@ is told me to try and contact you .
our conversation with Alex@@ is and your own publications - all supports the suggestion that working in your lab apparently will provide valuable opportunities to master method@@ ological and research skills .
not to mention the participation in pione@@ ering study .
my own work is dedicated to the study of changes in cell - cell contacts and in act@@ in cy@@ tos@@ ke@@ le@@ ton that take place during ne@@ op@@ l@@ astic transformation of epi@@ the@@ li@@ al cells .
earlier I had a publication in P@@ Lo@@ S One with description of dis@@ similarities in organization and regulation of ad@@ her@@ ence jun@@ ctions associated with different types of act@@ in bun@@ dles in normal and transformed epi@@ the@@ li@@ al cells .
thereafter I studied accumulation of various act@@ in - binding proteins and act@@ in iso@@ forms within ad@@ her@@ ence jun@@ ction in normal and transformed cells .
on the co@@ arse of this investigation I have obtained some promising results which I &apos;m going to report on the F@@ E@@ BS - EM@@ BO conference which will take place in Paris in the beginning of September .
also I &apos;m preparing materials for the next publication .
yours respectfully ,
D@@ mit@@ ry Lav@@ ro@@ v

I am writing about an important historical place which is my favourite one , I am referring to Lu@@ go city .
I visited Lu@@ go last summer and I enjoyed myself very much .
I walked through the old city , through its beautiful squares and parks and I visited its numerous churches , including the cathedral .
there are a lot of places in Lu@@ go worth visiting .
for example , you can walk around the Roman Wall , which has been declared a protected UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2000 because it is the only Roman Wall in the world that is complete .
I think that Lu@@ go is very beautiful .
there are a lot of shops where tourists and visitors can buy souvenirs and there are many restaurants where you can eat delicious and typical dishes , for example , octopus .
in Lu@@ go , many traditional parties and festivals take place .
among the most important I can mention San Fro@@ il@@ án and Ar@@ de Luc@@ us .
from 4th to 12th October Lu@@ go holds its San Fro@@ il@@ án fi@@ est@@ as .
San Fro@@ il@@ án is a festival of National Tourist Inter@@ est .
this festival is dedicated to the city &apos;s patron sa@@ int , and it shows traditional Gal@@ ician costumes and folklore .
another important festival in Lu@@ go is Ar@@ de Luc@@ us .
it is celebrated in June .
during this fes@@ tivity , Lu@@ go becomes the 3rd century town once again , so you can see Roman circus , Celtic weddings , artisan markets , many musical events taking place and local people and visitors get into period costumes , such as gladi@@ ators and Roman Em@@ per@@ ors .
I recommend you visit Lu@@ go in June because Ar@@ de Luc@@ us is celebrated .
you can enjoy traditional Roman customs and Roman life in Ar@@ de Luc@@ us .
Lu@@ go is and incredible city and it is important in the history of my country because it is full of historical places , fes@@ tivities which show and perform precise periods of the history of Spain , such as the Celtic period and the Roman period .
the bigger the city , bigger the problem .
the town is the 2nd largest urban ag@@ gl@@ omer@@ ation in the country , producing daily large amounts of waste . &quot;
city X &quot; has no specific waste disposal plan , but a federal law establi@@ shes a due term until 1st July .
despite it , there are a few plans to increase the green areas and revit@@ alize the town .
the city is thriving on implementing new measures to achieve the Council &apos;s goals .
the analysis will consist of evaluating the Council &apos;s eco - friendly proposals .
in accor@@ d with the aforementioned , the amount of garbage produced during the years 2007 and 2010 more than doubled , 8@@ 6% of it discarded in@@ adequately .
this is due to the low effect of the &quot; Rec@@ ycling worms &quot; program over the disposal problem . &quot;
city X &quot; in@@ cin@@ er@@ ates hospital residue , in accordance with legal requirements , and send 7% of the garbage production to recycling factories .
the recycling factories have a joint venture with the municipality to sort waste , and show a result 20% better than last year .
the program represents 2% of the employment in the city , but it needs to expand .
the city has many projects such as the &quot; Keep it clean , keep it beauty &quot; , whose goal is to promote proper disposal in the public areas .
another important one is the &quot; Let &apos;s make it green &quot; , responsible for increasing the green areas within the city in 15@@ 0% during the last two years , consisting of a combination of public and private investment in re@@ forestation of rural and communal areas .
a later crucial activity are the &quot; Green Comm@@ unities &quot; , currently carrying 38@@ % of the total amount of consumed vegetables in the metropolitan area .
a municipal waste policy that integr@@ ates private and public sectors and the community is required to solve the current problem .
the city needs a joint venture to support a functional and sustainable commerce of recycled rubbish .
the increase of green areas represent a significant improvement in the quality of life according to the US@@ ED report of 2012 and also fits in 16 of 20 requirements of a city of the future .
most of the &quot; Rec@@ ycling worms &quot; problem is caused by this lack of training , which can be resolved by training offered in the surrounding universities .
it is a good idea to take a year off between leaving school and starting university , because you can have lots of new experiences .
for example , you can travel to new places .
another idea is you can work , you can find a job and earn money before you start university .
moreover , sometimes people are tired when they finish school because of the exams so they need to have some time to relax .
you can travel to different countries if you have time , I would like to go to Asia , Thailand or China .
but you need to earn money if you want to travel , so you can first work and then travel .
you can find work as a waiter or in a shop .
however , some people think you should go to university immediately after you finish school because if you do n&apos;t , you forget what you have learned in school .
but I think you can also learn if you travel or if you work so that is a good idea also , especially if you find a job related with what you want to study .
we live in a time when everything changes quickly .
a technological development make people believe that in the future everything will look like in science - fiction movies .
we &apos;ll be surrounded by machines and robots .
we &apos;ll have a possibility to choose on which planet we want to live .
and what about houses ?
will people &apos;s homes be different or still the same ?
imagining the future , I see everything different .
the av@@ ant - gar@@ de and fu@@ turistic projects of houses will be the most desirable .
the houses will have , for example , the shape of a sphere or ig@@ loo .
some of them might be turned upside down .
sometimes they will be some kind of a modern art and it will be hard to describe a shape .
and what about inter@@ iors ?
in our service there will be more machines and robots with an artificial intelligence .
they will practically do everything : clean , cook , remind us what we have to do and also speak with us like an average human .
in practice there will be no normal furniture , just machines waiting for a command .
everything will be artificial and un@@ cool .
that &apos;s how I see a home of the future .
glad to hear that you &apos;ve been invited to attend the last round of interview next month !
I really hope to work with you someday !
to make sure you get the position successfully , here are some useful advice and information you might want to know .
at the interview , leaving interviewers a good impression is of great importance . Her@@ e@@ &apos;re some tips on how to do it .
first , dressing as properly as possible .
business@@ like suits and ties fit in well with the formal occasion .
suitable dressing comes across as effective and reliable .
second , being punctual .
interviewers have to cope with tight schedule everyday so they are n&apos;t willing to spare one more minute to wait for a candidate who &apos;s late somehow .
third , being prepared .
as the old saying goes , well prepared is half done .
you &apos;re expected to know something about our company , ask proper questions and communicate effectively with interviewers .
if you can learn as much knowledge about our company as you can up front , you really stand a chance in the interview .
since you &apos;ve applied for the sales assistant in the sales department , the sales manager will be interviewing you .
he started out his career as an accountant , but he was fed up with dealing with numbers all day long .
plus , he &apos;s willing to communicate with others and take on new challenges so he transferred to the sales department two years ago .
he got promoted very quickly because he always brought forth new ideas and facilit@@ ated the reform and development in the department .
in his eyes , what counts most is the track record and the capabilities shown in the previous working experiences , so he might ask you some questions like what you achieved and how you felt about your last job .
I hope what I mention above will be of some help to you .
looking forward to hearing from you soon .
lots of Love ,
ir@@ is
dear Sir or Madam
I write in connection with your advertisement regarding jobs at summer camps all over the USA .
since my mother tongue is English , albeit of the British variety , and I am generally deemed cheerful , energetic and hard working , I believe I am a suitable candidate for the aforementioned position .
additionally , as a teenager , I supervised a Wolf Cu@@ b pack of eight to twelve - year - olds , and often organised sports and evening activities for them , such as treasure hun@@ ts and paper chases .
moreover , when an undergraduate , I spent my summers working in the college canteen as a kitchen help , and progressed to the position of cook .
because of all the above points , I think I am a suitable person for the job .
yours faithfully
I find it quite difficult to find an area of improvement given And@@ res &apos;s outstanding overall performance .
yet , of@@ ten@@ times , being overly respectful may play against him and although he has gained the respect of all the people he has worked with , some of them suggested he should build up his self - confidence , rather than end up attempting to cover everyone &apos;s back and taking ownership for other people &apos;s mistakes .
if I had my own language school I would first bear in mind a main goal : raising public awareness of my language school and the services it will provide .
then I would start gathering some information about the market , that is to say , social trends , population statistics such as age , gender and family type , potential customers and competitors as well .
by doing so , I would be able not only to identify the strengths and weaknesses of my product and to improve my performance but also to identify customers &apos; needs .
after that , I would make a list of target markets and device some strategies to attract them .
for instance , if my goal was to increase young people &apos;s awareness , some strategies could be to increase online social media presence by posting regular updates about my language school on Twitter and Facebook or to offer discounts for siblings .
instead , if my goal was to increase adult &apos;s awareness , advertising in local newspapers or offering intensive courses could prove successful .
however , if the target markets were both , young people and adults , offering discounts for family groups could be a better choice .
the last step would be to recruit a staff of professional , experienced and qualified teachers and to set an attractive and reasonable price for the services I would provide .
last but not least , I would test ideas and approaches on customers and staff to make sure that my marketing plan succeeded .
and you ?
have you ever thought about how you can promote your language courses for example ?
I challenge you to think about it and try it .
according to recent research , there are no doubts that natural gas drilling ri@@ gs , natural gas pi@@ pel@@ ines and underground gas storage contribute to increasing wealth of the local communities .
people who live in the areas of natural gas infrastructure earn from a few to several percent more than those who live in other regions where such an infrastructure does n&apos;t exist .
another advantage is that developing natural gas industry equals new jobs what is profitable for people living in whereabouts .
exploration and extraction of the sh@@ ale gas will create lots of new jobs in very different branches connected with gas industry for instance in exploration , mining , production and distribution of sh@@ ale gas .
we can not ignore the fact that companies which cooperate with this infrastructure will also create vacancy jobs .
even if companies will hire engineers and specialists mostly from abroad , there will be growth in a number of job positions in gastronomy and hospitality zones as they need to eat and sleep somewhere .
according to the dynamics of development of the natural gas infrastructure , there will be constant development in gastronomy and hospitality sectors as well .
the K@@ osci@@ us@@ z@@ ko Institute conducted a research which shows that Poland can benefit from extracting and developing the infrastructure of sh@@ ale gas
Greece is an amazing country that a lot of people visit annually .
when planning their vacation a lot of tourists are faced with the dilemma of which places to visit .
choosing where to go in Greece can be hard as there are so many choices .
there are some travel destinations that definitely stand out , such as Sant@@ or@@ ini .
sandy beaches , crystal clear waters and the friendly locals are not the only things that set it apart from other islands .
Sant@@ or@@ ini also has a volcano which is a spectacular sight , even though exploring it can be dangerous !
another place worth visiting in Greece is Athens .
believe it or not , Athens is one of the most beautiful cities in the world .
the Par@@ then@@ on , the ac@@ rop@@ olis Museum and the district of Mon@@ as@@ ti@@ ra@@ ki are just a few of the things that people love about Athens .
last but not least , Cre@@ te is one of the most spectacular islands in Greece .
other than having beautiful sandy beaches and being the largest island in Greece , people can visit the water sports parks there , which are extremely fun !
summing up , Greece is a beautiful country worth visiting , although choosing where to go can be hard .
the question is whether it &apos;s better to prepare for a long time before the exam or few days are going to be enough .
in my personal experience , I believe that it &apos;s much better to prepare for a long time before any exam you may face in your life .
it &apos;s quite important to be organized to get the highest score you can get in your exam .
for example , one year ago , I had my final surgery exam .
I had set up a plan to study all the books we had to go through for the exam plus reviewing them twice .
the plan required my commitment for around a 12 hours daily study for almost 3 months .
for the hard work and perfect discipline , I was able to get a very high score in my Surgery finals .
if I had n&apos;t had such an organized plan , I would never have got such a perfect score .
another thing to add is not being stressed before the exam night .
it &apos;s quite normal to have this basic feeling of being stressed and nervous when exams are approaching .
what is not normal at all is having anxiety due to the plethora of studies you have n&apos;t finished and are included in your exam .
for example , I once had a chemistry exam in high school and I was ignorant enough to neglect my studies thinking that I still had enough time to ace my exam .
two days before my exam , I realized that I ran out of time .
I had insomnia the night of my exam , it was n&apos;t enough that I was n&apos;t well prepared but also my nerves got torn out and that affected my scores tremendously .
ever since I do everything in its due time in order not to be overly stressed and get low scores .
moreover , if I aim at getting high scores , I assert that memorizing the details is important .
if you do n&apos;t start studying before exam with an appropriate time , you will only have enough time to know the broad lines of the subject , but this will never help you soak the details and understand the concepts lying behind every single word .
that will help you a lot even if you do n&apos;t get the chance to revise everything before your exam .
I can recall that time when I was quite ill before my Anatomy exam ; I could only go through the main titles of each branch without going through the details .
in the exam , I had that question where it required describing a concept ; amazingly , I was able to do it perfectly .
since I had practiced a lot and memorized that concept before many times , I was able to remember it .
it was just flooding without so much effort .
so , for sure having enough time to memorize and practice what you learn is going to help you a lot in your exam .
in sum , I believe that setting a schedule to have a long time preparation plan is much better than having only few days to get prepared . if you want to get high scores and perform greatly , you should start studying from day one if possible .
do n&apos;t you think you are worth getting the highest score one could aim at ?
in my opinion , nuclear energy has the best chance to replace fossil fuels .
firstly , nuclear energy is n&apos;t bad for the environment .
the Car@@ bon dioxide emissions is very small .
the biggest threat is the explosion .
however , the technology is evolving and nuclear power plants are getting safer .
secondly , nuclear power plants are already very popular and this type of energy is the closest to replace fossil fuels .
energy which we get from sun and wind is still are only a few percent of world energy production .
Thirdly , only the construction of a nuclear power plant is expensive .
when we have a plant , making energy from that is very cheap .
the most expensive thing in nuclear plant is to hire qualified personnel .
besides , we need something that can work all the time .
it ca n&apos;t stop making energy when the weather is bad , because people need a lot of electricity .
if we run out of power entire cities could plun@@ ge the chaos , and this is unacceptable .

Hi Jane ,
last time you asked me for some information about opening a saving account in the UK . I &apos;ve done some research to find out the best savings account for you .
below you can find a few suggestions of mine .
the Phone Bank might give quite a good offer for you .
firstly , the rate of interest is by 3.@@ 1% , which is quite good .
additionally , if you open a saving account in that bank , you will get a diary as a gift .
and you do not need to pay any annual charges for having a credit card .
unfortunately , the bank does n&apos;t have branches in Britain .
and all banking operations must be done by phone .
the second bank , Royal Sav@@ ings Bank , has many branches in the UK ( over 650 ) , so you can make all bank operations on spot .
but there is a service charge for owning a credit card ( £ 12 per year ) .
you do also get a gift as a new account holder , a full set of sauce pans ( do you really need it ? ) .
all in all , I would recommend you to open your first serving account in the Phone Bank , since the rate of interest is higher and you do n&apos;t need to pay any annual charges .
and doing operations by phone are actually very easy and they always give you a great opportunity to improve your English .
the final decision is yours .
take care and see you very soon ,
yours Ag@@ ni@@ es@@ z@@ ka

subject : an important thing to do !
my dear Paul ,
I &apos;m writing to tell you how happy I am that I had the opportunity to be the chosen person to deal with the sound recording at Lady Gaga &apos;s concert .
it must have been my friend , Mari@@ us Bon@@ i , who recommended me for this service .
I could n&apos;t believe my ears when the phone rang and I answered and they said they wanted me to get at the concert as soon as possible to see how good I was in sound recording .
what can I say ?
it &apos;s been my dream since childhood and now I was overwhelmed when I realised they thought at me to do this for such a great , important person in the world music industry .
I am glad that they were satisfied with my service .
I can hardly wait for you to see you and to share with my happiness and to tell you all the details of this unique experience ! ! !
yours ,
I@@ on@@ ut
I have been skiing for most of life and I am very enthusiastic about it .
I started when I was six with equipment that was very basic compared to what ski@@ ers use these days .
every day as soon as I woke up I looked forward to my morning on the slopes .
my parents would take me to a gentle slope with my brother and leave us there for a couple of hours to try skiing on our own .
the temperature was often several degrees below zero , and you would freeze if you did n&apos;t keep moving up and down the slope .
my brother showed a natural talent for the sport , but I felt quite uncomfortable and scared .
little by little I improved my skiing skills and by the time I was a teenager I really started enjoying myself .
nowadays I have a lot of fun skiing because it gives me the opportunity to be in a wonderful natural environment .
skiing is a great sport , but I would recommend starting as a child , taking a few lessons with an experienced instructor and using the right equipment .
after six years of rigorous high school subjects and past experiences , I have no doubt that the preferences I &apos;ve selected above are not accidental .
I am extremely interested in gaining experience in the business field .
the subjects I &apos;ve pursued at my high school level such as financial accounting , commerce and economics has given me the opportunity to utilize and put into perspective the knowledge of understanding business concepts and has given me a solid academic foundation .
I &apos;ve also participated in various group works and class projects while in high school .
I am planning to gain admission into the university of my choice in order to obtain a bachelor &apos;s degree .
I would love to associate with extremely talented students , lectur@@ ers and even professors in order to receive a well rounded introduction to the numerous aspects of any of the preferences I &apos;ve selected above .
academically , I &apos;ve always been a very determined and studi@@ ous individual and I would be more than willing to devote myself to the hard work necessary in order to achieve a bachelor &apos;s degree .
I also have an indu@@ b@@ itable passion for extra - curricular activities .
I was the president of the Business Students Association ( B@@ SA ) , Head Boy ( senior pref@@ ect boy ) and Captain of the soccer school team .
I am a very good soccer player who plays a mid@@ field role .
under@@ taking a scholarship and admission into one of the universities I have selected above will provide me with the opportunity to apply the knowledge gained at high school into a business setting , as well as develop the communication , organisation and numer@@ acy skills I have acquired at high school .
after I heard about the Czech Government Schol@@ ar@@ ship , I decided to make some research on Czech Republic before taking any step in applying .
I found out that Czech Republic is a country with rich possibilities for students planning to study abroad and is currently undergoing rapid social changes and transformation , making it a fascinating place for students of any discipline to study in .
Czech universities provides high standards of education , internationally recognized degrees , modern camp@@ uses with outstanding facilities , safe and affordable education warm and friendly environment and cultural diversity .
I believe that I will have the opportunity to experience both moder@@ nity and tradition in one if the safest and most stable countries in Europe .
above all , the high quality if education will make me ready for the future .
another major reason why I am being motivated to study in Czech Republic is lack of finance .
also , education in Nigeria is now a joke as teachers and lectur@@ ers go on strike frequently , and learning in some parts of Nigeria are not safe !
right now , I am greatly looking forward to the challenges of a university life academically , socially and mentally , and I believe that my ambition to learn new business concepts coupled with my passion for extra - curricular activities and community service , would make me a competent addition to the any of my proposed university and the Czech Republic Schol@@ ar@@ ship team .
I believe that I can make a positive contribution to my proposed university , as I will be actively involved in student events and activities that will help to promote a healthy learning environment for all .
in conclusion , I can assure you that I will be a capable and dedicated student who has the commitment and dedication to work hard in order to be a graduate , whilst at the same time , contributing greatly to my proposed university in more ways than one .
a dog is man &apos;s best friend
it is a well - known fact that people need to have communication with other people .
however , they are not always satisfied or taken into the society .
they seek sol@@ ace in someone who they would feel more comfortable with .
the best example is an animal with great qualities , a dog .
dog &apos;s personality is one of their best qualities .
always friendly , bu@@ b@@ bly and in a good mood , they are great to spend time with .
they feel when their master is sad and react by cud@@ dling up to them .
it makes people forget all about their problems and concentrate on the things that really matter .
dog &apos;s optimism is by far the best way to bring back a smile on people &apos;s face .
and that is what they are there for , to make people happy .
these ha@@ iry four - legged animals are also very protective .
one of their jobs is to watch out their human family .
so if they sense that their owner might be in danger , they immediately react by barking at a person or a thing thing that might have caused it .
the stronger the bond between the dog and their owner , the stronger the dog &apos;s reaction will be .
it is believed that dogs require a lot of attention , which is not true .
dogs are really not that hard to take care of , bathing and g@@ room@@ ing do n&apos;t need to be done every day , they just need to be fed and walked regularly .
these pets need a few walks a day , which could also be good for their owners who are spending all day at work or in school and need some physical activity .
so having a dog could also remind them to live a healthier life .
in conclusion , dogs make really great pets .
not only do they protect you from anything that could do you any harm , but their amazing personality and the love they show to you makes you feel so warm and wonderful on the inside .
so if someone really loves their pet , they would find time to pay lot of attention to them , because , they truly are man &apos;s best friend .
Hi John !
it &apos;s great to hear from you again ! I will give you some details about my experience at &quot; Z@@ oe K@@ ak adventure &quot; , one of the most well - known centres in our country .
first of all , we started with a tiring assault course , which consisted of climbing up pretty sharp walls and crawling through different obstacles .
although it made me feel exhausted , I found it extremely entertaining .
luckily , I was fit enough to finish the exercise without having any problem , however , you may need to train a little bit more before embar@@ king on this activity .
rock climbing was another of the challenges I had to face .
despite the fact that it turned out to be harder than I had expected , I managed to reach the summit .
you ca n&apos;t imagine how rewarding is the feeling of being on the top of the mountain , after such a big effor@@ t@@ !@@ .
furthermore , you will be able to practise canoeing . you are likely to feel scared at first , but your confidence will be built up quickly , due to the constant support of your teachers .
one of the last activities offered by the centre was diving .
I felt so overwhelmed that I had to give it up , so if you do n&apos;t want to miss out this great opportunity too , trust your trainers , since they are highly qualified .
to sum up , I strongly believe that you will have a great time there and I guarantee you that all the teachers meet with the safety rules , so you will enjoy a lot without getting yourself into trouble .
for all these reasons , this centre &apos;s really worth a visit
write soon and let me know if you need to know anything else .
with best wishes :
Sara .
I felt so excited when I looked at the envelope on the desk of my room .
I checked the address as quickly as I could and I realized that I was right , it was from Paris ...
my mother had written me after months !
since she left to Paris last year I had been living in the school residence , which was n&apos;t cheerful at all , what made me feel really depressed .
but I had her letter at last , so I started to read it immediately .
she told me that when I was on holidays I had to buy myself a plane ticket to Paris and go to visit her for at least two months because she was missing me a lot .
it felt so good when I saw that my mother had n&apos;t forgotten me .
I had never travelled to Europe yet so I was really nervous too , but it would be a great chance to improve my French and spend a lot of time with my beloved mother in the city of love .

education is a milestone in our life and having a good education is the main door to the labor market .
aware parents disappointed with educational systems and institu@@ tion@@ alized education try to spot in homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling a solution for their children &apos;s education .
although homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling may seem , according to some of these parents &apos; opinions , &quot; a paved road &quot; , it
is a path not suitable for everybody &apos;s cars and that compels us to seek other routes .
homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling should not be considered a cold - wide phenomenon since only a few countries : the UK ,
Canada , and especially the USA , can boast .
there are lots of countries that do not
accept homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling as a legal alternative so far and others where it is just an isolated happening .
the situation in Spain can be assessed as &quot; legal vacuum &quot; in light of our constitutional right to free
education meanwhile attendance is compulsory in elementary and secondary education .
educational and emotional freedom support this alternative way of learning .
homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling may also free up time for complementary activities such as music , sports , and even the family life .
homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ led students &apos; success has been backed up by the results on standardi@@ ze test and the recognition of prestigious universities .
now though , before homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling your kids you also have to consider the same amount of road@@ blocks :
the lack of facilities or expertise , not enough soci@@ alization for your children , ending up being a frustrated parent without enough money to make ends meet .
as far as I am concerned I want to think about homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling as a wake up call for educational
systems .
however , homes@@ ch@@ oo@@ ling will never succeed if parents do not have the right skills .
as traditional education seems to be exhausted , new technologies open up as &quot; the
solution &quot; and bl@@ ended learning is the future .
Geographic and natural environment around the building space , as well as the neighbourhood , would be surely taken into consideration while designing houses of the future .
obviously , the future also indicates a home with more technology and very energy efficient systems .
in areas exposed to cat@@ ac@@ ly@@ sms , such as earthquakes , hurri@@ can@@ es and floods , people should have their houses built of resistant materials .
steel or concrete structures would give the desired effect in this particular matter .
environmentally friendly buildings will be definitely on the drawing board .
built with recyclable or recycled materials , the exterior surface of these houses should be ready to be lit by daylight on sunny days , not to mention sky@@ lights and solar panels on the roofs , which is more and more popular even these days .
moreover , solar energy collec@@ tors ought to be controlled by computers in order to maxim@@ ise comfort and energy efficiency .
urban housing issues ( such as population growth ) will be solved by exploiting some new areas .
maybe it &apos;s building castles in the air , but house@@ boats and apartments situated above city streets seem to be a perfect solution to use up space that would otherwise be wasted .
although people would keep mul@@ ling over how to moderni@@ ze their fancy houses ( and br@@ ag@@ ging about it to neighbours ) , they will still need a warm , cosy bed and a nice cup of tea .
I suppose that will never change , even if they live in a concrete iv@@ ory tower .
catch it or lose it
the al@@ pha and the omeg@@ a of a good team is trust .
that &apos;s the most important point if you want to play handball .
you must be able to throw the ball blindly to your teammate and he has to catch it .
otherwise the opponent will have the chance to get a point .
are you a real team player ?
handball is one of the most dynamic sports in this world .
over eighty points can be made all together in sixty minutes , if not even more .
this shows how rapidly the game can change .
one lost ball can make your team the loser of the game .
I started to play handball when I was 5 years old .
at first , it was only a hobby but with the years it became passion .
what I love most about this sport is , the speed and the un@@ conditional team spirit .
if you want to practise handball , just be sure that you have a good team and do n&apos;t forget the fun !
triathlon : a famous sport throughout the world
it seems as if , recently , society has become more conscious of the importance of practising a sport .
clearly , this is a consequence of the extra hours we have to work per day and as a way of relaxing , we find doing a sport as an effective way of taking the stress of our bodies .
in fact , we can see many people jogging and cycling these days whether it is in the morning before going to work or even after .
despite these two being the most popular sports amongst at lets , many more are just as interesting and profitable .
one of them is triathlon , which is my favourite sport .
it consists of a mixture between three different sports , swimming , cycling and jogging and as a result it can be extremely demanding .
what I enjoy most about it is being able to practise it anywhere , which means I can do it near home instead of having to go to a sports center .
it also means I can choose the location that most pleas@@ es me and therefore fully enjoy the time spent doing it .
triathlon has become more popular over the past few years and more and more people are eager to try it .
therefore , it is crucial to understand that improving in such a demanding sport requires time and is is important to establish some goals in order to keep motivated .
you must not push yourself too far .
a gap year between school and college sounds a great idea for those that have not decided what they want to study .
however there are some questions whether it should be everyone or not .
first , I would like to put the arguments in favour of the year off .
not everybody has the financial possibilities to pay for college , so taking a gap year to earn money to help with the bills it is time well spend .
but that it is not the only reason to take a year off .
most of the people think that this year is to travel to other countries and spend all your time at parties , but this is not true , you can travel to develop your culture and do volunteer work , so you can become a better person .
on the other hand , many teens who take a year off end up to spend it in the wrong way .
for example , things might gone not as they had expected for multiple reasons such as not having en off money or not getting a job .
in conclusion , people should take a year off , but only when they have all planed and know for shore that they have the possibility to do something useful with their time .
Hello , my name is Li@@ dia , I am 27 years old and I am going to take just a minute of your time to explain why hiring me will benefit your organization .
I am currently studying in my fourth and final year of a degree in tourism at the University of the World Heritage city of Caceres , which is located in Spain .
in my third year , I did my internship as a receptionist in a four stars hotel during 2 months and a half in Bad@@ ajo@@ z .
I already have skills in listening closely to customers and avi@@ d understanding of front desk operations .
my previous experience working abroad in a hotel would be useful to your company .
I am flexible , a good team player , and capable to work under pressure .
my mother tongue is Spanish , but I am able to speak English fluently and I have a pre - intermediate level of Italian as well .
talking about my interests , traveling is one of the most activities I enjoy , in order to discover new places and cultures .
I also love meeting new people from another countries and exchange languages .
you may contact me through f@@ 8@@ H@@ J@@ 2@@ su@@ L@@ @@@ alum@@ nos@@ .@@ ab@@ c@@ d@@ .@@ es or just call me on 65@@ 9 12 34 56 .
thanks so much for taking the time to listen !
&quot; farmer G@@ iles of H@@ am &quot; is a fantasy story written by J.@@ R.@@ R. Tol@@ ki@@ en .
set in England in the first centuries of the Middle Ages , the story is about the adventures of G@@ iles , a farmer of the village of H@@ am who becomes a hero against his wishes by defe@@ ating a giant .
when the dragon Chr@@ ys@@ op@@ hy@@ la@@ x comes and devast@@ ates everything , he is sent twice against him , not only managing to defeat him thanks to the magic sword T@@ ail@@ bit@@ er , but also obtaining a huge treasure .
at the end of the story , G@@ iles becomes an independent king .
I liked a lot this story firstly because I love fantasy stories , especially Tol@@ ki@@ en &apos;s ones : they bring me to another universe , making me forget every day &apos;s life .
secondly it is very original because it is a sort of parody of traditional legends : the hero is an ordinary person , k@@ nights reveal fearful and incompetent and cl@@ ashes are won with words instead of weapons .
I would recommend this story to everybody because it is funny and adventurous and Tol@@ ki@@ en &apos;s ironic style , based also on the comical use of Latin words , makes it extremely pleasant to read .
dear Sir or Madam ,
I am writing this letter to apply for the position in USA Summer Camp that I saw advertised in our local newspaper .
I am interested in working in the Edu@@ ca@@ tional Institu@@ tions , or in the Social Care .
I have recently graduated from the Social Science University in Psychology and received high degrees in both my Teaching and supervi@@ sing Cour@@ ses .
in addition we had to have one year of volunteering in Youth supervi@@ sing environment in preparation for our finished assignment , so I am able to be a member of your well skilled staff .
since I was 13 years old , I have helped my parents with upbringing my four hunger siblings .
I have been involved in volunteering in a variety of youth organizations as supervisor and tutor .
in the past two years I have worked in the Scout Organization , helping area manager to organize activities for children .
this experience has given me the ability to cope with the needs of all types of children &apos;s personalities .
I have a friendly , happy personality and find that I enjoy the challenges of working in youth environments .
in addition , my studies and experience I have taught me to be accurate and efficient in organizing my work , so I would be a valuable addition to your team .
I look forward to hearing from you .
yours faithfully

does traveling broaden your mind ?
in my opinion , travelling does broaden your mind .
when visit different places , you get to see different environments , cultures , people and even different languages .
travelling helps you to develop as a person in many ways .
for example , if you learn another language different from your own one , even if it is just a few basic sentences , you can communicate with people from different regions and you improve your confidence .
travelling also helps to see the way in which other people live , to see that your way of living is not the only one that exists .
this can help you to understand that not everyone has access to many things you do have access too , and to realise that perhaps you should appreciate these things , such as smartphones , computers , cars or even fresh water , which is a basic resource and we tend to take for granted that everyone can have some water to drink even though this is not true .
besides , when we travel to different places we see there are many different cultures that differ greatly from our own culture , and we see how different from one another humans are .
for all of these reasons I think travelling really broadens your mind .
I want to build my career as a fully fle@@ dged researcher and academ@@ ician .
to fulfill this dream a PhD degree would be the most essential foot@@ step .
I am mostly also interested to pursue my PhD on Theore@@ tical and Compu@@ ta@@ tional Chemistry .
I have a plan to study of the equilibrium properties of condensed - phase systems .
I would also like to carry out my PhD research in the development of transition metal comple@@ xes which can be used as drugs against several human diseases , as cosmetics materials and as phot@@ onic and op@@ to@@ electronic materials in devices .
I also find Analy@@ tical Chemistry and Environmental Chemistry are the interesting fields of Chemistry because of their numerous applications .
I believe that I possess the strong motivation and intellectual capability to build a career in one of the previously mentioned fields .
after my PhD , I will return to my country and continue my teaching as well as research with students of University of Bar@@ is@@ al .
there is no future for public transport ?
the number of cars grow up rapidly , however the public transport is still in use .
especially in a big cities , where there are traffic jams , the public transport is becoming more and more popular again .
in some cities it &apos;s even forbidden to drive through the city center without some special permission , so there is no other solution than use a public transport .
but what is more convenient - own car or public transport ?
well it depends .... When you travel with your own car you are independent .
you do not have to worry about the schedule - you are a driver so it &apos;s your decision whenever you want to go or stay longer in some place .
you can listen to your favorite music or radio .
you are the boss .
however , as a driver you always have to be careful and watch out on the route .
if you want to travel from one place to another to see different places , your own car is the best solution .
it allows you to see much more in your pace .
but think about the costs .
think how much you pay for a petrol nowadays .
consider as well how many days do you have for vacations .
maybe cheap airlines are better ?
being back to our everyday life .
most of us are living in a big cities and face problems with the traffic .
what if we use the public transport to get to work ?
well , then you do n&apos;t have to worry about the parking space and you can read more books on the way to work .
simply , you can use the way to work as an additional time for yourself .
what else ?
after work you can go for a drink with your colleagues !
and if the ecology is important for you just think about the pollution .
let &apos;s reflect one again : is there a future for public transport ?
in my opinion : yes , there is !
is travelling by car more convenient ?
well , it depends !
why using the first narration ?
the first narration can attract readers &apos; attention at the beginning of the fri@@ ction and makes the readers get into the thoughts of the mad@@ man easily .
we ca n&apos;t understand what others think usually , but in this fri@@ ction , the author invited us know what inside the mad@@ man &apos;s mind .
feeling that the main character is talking to us , as if we were all involved in this case , the whole thing seemed like really happened .
facing the murder directly makes the horror penetr@@ ates into our hearts .
how does the author create a word of horror to his readers ?
the author created the horrible atmosphere by describing the scene , the dis@@ ordered mind and the sound of heart@@ beats .
first , the scene that described the murder makes readers ca n&apos;t help themselves emerging the images in their mind .
just like the mad@@ man &apos;s plan was happening right in front us .
then comes to the sound , the heart@@ beats .
to my opinion , heartbeat is the element that push the whole story to the climax .
every time when the sound of heart@@ beats started arou@@ sing , something en@@ sued .
in the first time , when the mad@@ man heard the heart@@ beats of the old man , he was going to kill the old man , and he did it .
the second time when mad@@ man heard the heart@@ beats , he became impatient , scared , excited and insane , in the end , he confessed that he killed the man and dis@@ memb@@ ered the corpse .
at the same time , the heart@@ beats also dragged the readers nervous and anxious .
finally , I think the way the author wanted to express the dis@@ ordered mind of the mad@@ man is his intonation .
the whole story except the end of the fri@@ ction he confessed the crime , the mad@@ man &apos;s used the intonation that is extremely calm and steady , to tell the readers the process of the cruel thing that he had done .
the sharp contract for the calm and the cruelty , leaves us a strong impression that the main character was totally insane and crazy .
shivering inside our hearts , the horror increases .
&quot; let &apos;s go to the forest to see the variety of animals which are found there &quot; , Max told to his friends one sunny afternoon .
when all was set , they started their trip to the forest .
when they arrived there , they started to look around trying to find different types of animals such as birds , rabbits and deer .
Max and his friends took a walk under the trees when , across the river , they saw something that looked like an animal lying on the gr@@ ass@@ . &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot; , Max said aloud .
they ran quickly , crossed the river and they reached the place where the animal was@@ . &quot; It &apos;s a deer ! , its leg is in a trap &quot; , Max &apos;s friend shouted .
when they saw the animal , they could see that it was suffering , so they decided to free the deer .
by this decision , Max took courage to open the trap , but the deer did n&apos;t move because its leg was injured .
one of Max &apos;s friend brought water from the river to give to the deer .
Max cut a piece of his T - shirt to cure the animal .
afterwards , the animal was better and it walked away slowly .
when the day finished , Max and his friends returned home feeling happy because they had saved the animal &apos;s life@@ . &quot; What an amazing day ! &quot; , Max whispered to himself as he got into bed that night .
the question is : whether it is possible to be famous without journalists ?
probably not , but they are many people in show - business or political life , who are ready to do everything to save their private life .
generally , people may be famous for two reasons : because of their job or because of their scand@@ alised private life .
if you decide to became famous because of your scand@@ alised private life , it would be silly to complain about tiring paparazzi .
there is a rule , probably one of the most important in public life , that says more or less : &apos; it is not important what are they talking about you , it is important they are talking about you &apos; .
most of celebrities follow this rule , as it is just what they are living for .
that is why they are often able to sell information about their private life .
real problem starts when journalists inj@@ ures not the celebrity , but its friends or family .
paparazzi are cruel in contact with famous people &apos;s children , that may have negative influence on their emotional development .
how about those who do not want to be popular because of scandals ?
in most cases they are just doing their job as well as they can , leading their boring life .
and when finally paparazzi notice that there is nothing interesting in their life , they just leave them alone .
summari@@ zing , I do believe that adult people are responsible enough to make a decision , if they want to share the most important part of their life with journalists .
and I hope they understand , their duty is to save their relatives .
great food is probably one of the most valuable pleasures of life .
as a person who loves to eat , I consider environment , quality of food and price as the main factors to decide where should I go .
last Friday I visited a brand new Mexican restaurant in Lis@@ bon called &quot; Las Fi@@ cher@@ as &quot; .
it was suggested by two friends of mine and according to them , because the good food and funny environment .
I went to dinner with more 6 friends in order to having fun and eat good Mexican food after a stressful week .
in my opinion , the food was good but the prices were too expensive considering the quantity served and the messy service .
we faced continuous problems with the order such as : dishes from another table served for us by mistake , the drinks were served with a considerable delay and the bill was shown even without asking ( just because we finished the dinner but our drinks were still on the table ) .
for my luck ( or not ) , I met a friend of mine on the day after that told me that she had dinner at &quot; Las Fi@@ cher@@ as &quot; before and in her opinion , as a Mexican , that restaurant was terrible .
she also told me that a great Mexican restaurant was just opened with lower prices and good service .
I got curious about this place and decided to go later .
&quot; pi@@ stol@@ a y Cor@@ az@@ ón Ta@@ qu@@ eria &quot; was the first Mexican restaurant that I could eat genuine Mexican food , with lower prices and a great service .
they served us &quot; n@@ ach@@ os &quot; with tomato sauce for free while we were choosing the main dishes .
after choosing , a bottle of fresh water was served , again , for free .
we chose &quot; tacos &quot; of meat with gu@@ ac@@ am@@ ole sauce and it was absolutely delicious .
after paying the bill , they offered us a shot of tequila to finish our visit confir@@ ming that great places still exists .
Hey ! I survived ! ! :)
first of all : thank YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND YOUR HELP WITH THE AR@@ T@@ IC@@ LE ! ! !
second of all , HOW ARE YOU ?
and also , where are you now ? ? :)
in my case ... I &apos;m much better now . I &apos;m settled back home and I &apos;m up and running , even though my un@@ secured sprained ankle has gone worst .
last week I was borrowed an ankle support and some cr@@ ut@@ ches , so ever since then it &apos;s going better .
furthermore , precisely today I have started my 15@@ -@@ day rehabilitation sessions !
so I should be back on jumping around in no time :) .
as you know , Malta was a big punch right in the stomach , which for sure I did n&apos;t need ! :@@ ( .
the course and the organization left much to be desired ; and as if that were n&apos;t enough , my scholarship ( funny enough not the ones of the ( only ! ) TWO other participants ) , was not sufficient to cover all the costs ! :@@ /
anyway , CS and magic saved me right at the last second ( the last night ) , and I left Malta with a smile and a warmed up heart .
and for that I want to TH@@ AN@@ K YOU once again .
back home , everything started fast -@@ I should have gotten used to by now , should n&apos;t I@@ ? ?@@ - .
so I had n&apos;t have time for much .
I have been totally immerse in looking for jobs and in the translation of the scientific paper for a former student of mine .
he decided to finish the second half without my help , so that was a bit disappointing , both for the feeling of not meeting his expectations * and for the ( I &apos;m guessing , as I do n&apos;t know anything as yet :@@ / ) less money earned that it will mean .
* Sorry , I &apos;m gon na ( ab@@ )@@ use of your native language skills once again : here &quot; not meeting his expectations &quot; , could be substitu@@ ted by another expression .
what I doubt is the difference between this bunch : be good enough , measure up , make the grade ; be up to standard / the task .
there again , having a whole bunch of free hours ( days !
from Sunday to Tuesday ) for myself that I was not counting on , proved itself to make wonders ! ! !
I decided to get back home ( I had been the whole week at my friend &apos;s place , as he lives in Madrid and quite close to the writer &apos;s house , where I had been going every day last week ) , and I started getting things done . plus I gave a rest to my ankle , which was very much needed too !
the two - day one - night trip with my mother and sister went quite well .
the place we were visiting was very beautiful , and have n&apos;t been because of the limitations for my ankle , we would have gone for a short hike .
tomorrow I &apos;ll be starting my first English class , which has taken much longer than I had plan .
I have sent a lot of CVs , and have gone to 3 interviews so far , also for English classes ( one company and two acade@@ mies ) .
about the pictures from Ram@@ la , could you wait a bit more time ?
I have n&apos;t find time to download the pictures ( from ALL THE TH@@ INGS that I need to sort out , I was ( and is ) definitely NOT a priority .
do remind me again , thou , if you see that I &apos;m forgetting , okay ?
( please ! ) .
did you ask Mario about the speakers ?
because chatting is way faster than writing ;@@ ) .
I &apos;m gon na go now .
talk to you soon , Mike .
receive a big hug from ( YES , FIN@@ ALLY ! ! ) warm Spain .
global warming and its consequences in 2015
the Gu@@ ardi@@ an &apos;s article &quot; World &apos;s climate about to enter &apos; un@@ char@@ ted territory &apos; as it passes 1@@ C of warming &quot; , published on the 9th November 2015 , describes the problems of global warming .
referring to scientists at the British Met Office , 2015 is going to be the year when the milestone of 1@@ C warming will be broken - caused by global warming - which will lead to unknown consequences on the future .
the World Meteorological Organization made known public@@ ly that 2015 has been the hottest year on record as well as it has caused more carbon dioxide on average by burning fossil fuels .
these problems just announced recently will be issues to talk about at the UN summit in Paris in three weeks .
then , world leaders will be negotiating about cutting the increased carbon emissions coupled with the El Ni@@ ño climate phenomenon .
Stephen Bel@@ cher , director of the Met Office &apos;s H@@ ad@@ ley Centre , claims that humanity is to blame for climate changes as the rise of temperature or the catastrophe expected by scientists when global warming rises beyond 2@@ C. This opinion is also represented by the British Secretary of energy and climate change , Amber R@@ ud@@ d , who considers the climate change to be one of the greatest problems in nowadays &apos; politics due to its consequences on economy , global security and the fight against poverty .
she stands up for a global deal confirmed on the UN summit by the leading states and therefore these climate targets should be a role - model for other countries .
furthermore , climate scientist E@@ d Haw@@ kins expects a continuation of global warming , clarifying this statement with the example of Central England , which has warmed 20% more than the global average .
global warming in general leads to more natural disasters as flooding , heat@@ waves , water stress and loss of harv@@ ests .
facing these consequences , a 4@@ C warming would be even more damaging according to Bel@@ cher .
despite the result of a NASA study pointing out that there would have been an ice mass grew in An@@ tar@@ c@@ ti@@ ca from 2003 - 2008 , there is only a small chance of 5 - 10% that this pro@@ gn@@ osis will come true according to Prof Andrew She@@ pherd , University of L@@ eeds , as the study has already been proven wrong by 57 other studies .
although the NASA study shows a different result , the majority of scientists see global warming as a dangerous threat for this planet in terms of living conditions , environment and economy and as well as an issue of the UN summit in Paris .
the problem lies in the outdated framework in which the I@@ W@@ C operates .
fifteen whaling nations formed the I@@ W@@ C after whale populations collapsed .
the organisation was initially set up to conserve whales only to the extent that they could continue to be used by humans .
the importance of World Heritage properties tran@@ sc@@ ends national boundaries .
their qualities are extraordinary so that no matter which country they are found in , and who experiences them , they evoke a sense of wonder and admiration .
to be included on the World Heritage List , properties must be of outstanding universal value and meet at least one of ten selection criteria .
the World heritage list is important because it attracts tourists and these landmarks are cherished by everyone around the world .
it is also protected by UNESCO because they have found new animals or plants ; there are endangered spices in that area or have a significant importance in history .
world Heritage is the desig@@ nation for places on Earth that are of outstanding universal value to humanity and as such , have been in@@ scri@@ bed on the World Heritage List to be protected for future generations to appreciate and enjoy .
the site is the property of the country on whose territory it is located , but it is considered in the interest of the international community to protect the site for future generations .
its protection and preservation becomes a concern of the international World Heritage community as a whole .
another advantage for a site to be in@@ scri@@ bed on the List is that once a country signs the Convention , and has sites in@@ scri@@ bed on the World Heritage List ; the resulting prestige often helps raise awareness among citizens and governments for heritage preservation .
greater awareness leads to a general rise in the level of the protection and conservation given to heritage properties .
a country may also receive financial assistance and expert advice from the World Heritage Committee to support activities for the preservation of its sites .
the Dis@@ advantages of sites not included in the World Heritage List are that these sites are not funded so they ca n&apos;t protect them for risks .
moreover they remind in the list of sites in danger without to receive assistance .
in my opinion the sites in danger unless they not answer at ten criteria should be protect for UNESCO .
it &apos;s difficult , but I think that it is necessary try to invent new way to finance and defend the natural and cultural heritage .
cricket is my passion .
I love playing , watching and talking about it .
it &apos;s my first passion and I am following it as far as my earliest memory goes .
cricket is a team sport which teaches us team work , collaboration and strict discipline .
it also teaches us how to overcome individual weaknesses and gain advantage of others strength to succeed as a team .
I started playing cricket since my early childhood .
even when I was a kid I started playing with boys of much higher age than me .
it gave me a lot of confidence and a chance to improve my skills rapidly .
I followed cricket religi@@ ously and have watched almost every match India played .
Sach@@ in T@@ end@@ ul@@ k@@ ar is my favorite cricke@@ ter .
I am fan of his batting .
he has broken almost every record in cricket history .
apart from his cri@@ c@@ keting skills I loved his ability to handle pressure and his calm nature in all situations .
if someone wants to learn more about cricket I will advise him to watch batting of great like Sach@@ in , Dra@@ vid , Lara and P@@ oin@@ ting .
to learn more about bowling one should watch Ak@@ ram , War@@ ne and Mur@@ li .
I will also advise reading more about cricket on cri@@ cin@@ fo . com .
it has nice articles , reviews and statistics on many players and games .
reading bio@@ grap@@ hi@@ es of some famous cricketers will also help to understand the insights of the game in deep .
cricket is going through rough phase due to match fixing and betting scandals .
but I am sure it will come strong out of this and will spread its wings all across the world and once again give its lovers a magnificent show .
I met a friend about one week ago , and he asked me a question that I ca n&apos;t stop thinking about : what is on my Buc@@ ket List ?
I ca n&apos;t stop thinking about it , because I realized that I had never stopped to think about my life in such a deep way .
by the way , do you know what a Buc@@ ket List is ?
it is a list of things that you want to do before you die .
I think is kind of sad , that I do n&apos;t know what I want to do , I do n&apos;t know what makes me truly happy .
about two weeks before I met him I watched a very beautiful movie called &quot; The fault in our stars &quot; .
it &apos;s about a teen couple who are dying because of cancer , and they have different ways to think about life and death .
this movie has touched me very deeply , it made me think about life and about the way people used to live without appreciating the really important things .
so after watching this movie and my friend &apos;s question I ca n&apos;t help thinking about my life .
now I have the feeling that I need to live more , but I have no idea what is this &quot; more &quot; .
before that I had always thought about getting married and having kids as a way to find happiness , but now I think that before this I need to do other things .
it is very interesting to think that it was necessary meet someone new , from another entire different culture to make me think about what I want .
it is very strange that another person became curious about a very profound part of me that I have never thought of .
well , next November I will travel to Europe , the only certain thing on my Buc@@ ket List that I know .
however , now I have an awful feeling about what I am doing today , because for the first time in my life I am sure that I need change something , and I think this &quot; something &quot; is almost everything .
peoples lives will change in the future , and I bet it &apos;s not for the better .
unlike popular understandings of History ( and even presumably scientific ones , I must say ) , History is not an unstoppable march towards &quot; progress &quot; , whatever that word means .
it is a cycli@@ cal process .
Rome had its he@@ yday in the first century AD , but just three centuries later it was only a shadow of its past .
those later period Romans were n&apos;t even able to make the high quality cement that their ancestors were able to make and have technical mastery over just a few centuries earlier .
and who can safely say that three centuries from now humans will possess all the technological knowledge that they possess now and take for granted ?
no one can assure such a thing .
but I do n&apos;t think , unless there &apos;s another World War , people &apos;s lives will change dramatically in the next 50 years .
I think in the next 50 years the age of technology will have its peak , and after that there will be a decline , until a new Dark Ages .
but let &apos;s pick the World War hypothesis for a second .
a wide world war is the only case in which we would see a dramatic change in peoples lives in the time length of 50 years from now .
but there &apos;s , at this day , prospects for a new World War ?
I do n&apos;t think so , but on the other hand what the hell do I know ?
the causes that will lead to a new World War may well be in existence right now for all I know , and no one , or only a few very wise and intelligent people know about it .
one day in the future another Franz Fer@@ din@@ and could be killed , and that symbo@@ lic event could serve again as an excuses to some country declare war to another , but the true underlying causes that actually led the countries to wage war against each other would have its roots in much older times .
as the causes of the Second World War had its roots on events that were the outcome of the First War , a Third , hypothetical war , could have its roots on a past conflict that may well have happened already .
but let &apos;s not di@@ gres@@ sed into that , that &apos;s all another topic that falls beyond the scope of the statement on which I was supposed to write a composition .

subject : holidays are coming !
Hi Sam ,
it has been a long time since we were in touch and now I am very pleased that we are on holiday and we can plan something together .
my family and I are going to spend some days at the same place we went to last year , at the Sunshine Holiday Camp .
do you remember it ?
I &apos;ve already mentioned to you how much fun I had there and why it was great !
it would be terrific if you came with me , is it possible ?
could you ask your parents &apos; permission ?
in this Camp parents are calm and do n&apos;t worry about their children because they are in the care of a large number of assistants and the camp is situated on an entire island .
in addition , the site was purpose built to provide places fit for young people allowing them to do lots of activities in safety .
there are a wide range of activities promoted by the staff all with the aim of enjoyment , especially outdoor sport activities !
there are two swimming pool , two tennis court , one football pitch , canoeing courses and so on but what I like most is the scuba diving , and the equipment is provided .
the Camp is well - known and opens from May to October and it would be good to book within two weeks , it always get over@@ booked for the period my parents can take days off , what do you think coming with us from the 1st August to the 15th ?
I am look forward to receiving your answer !
best wishes .

the doorbell rang unexpectedly . I had fallen asleep on the couch watching TV .
I got up and I made my way to the front door .
outside stood the most extraordinary - looking man : he looked like a Spanish elephant hunter .
I was taken ab@@ ack , so I called my mother , who was asleep with her boyfriends .
she came down , but she did not scream .
instead she started crying .
the man as it turned out was my father , who had been missing for 15 years ...
I did not know that he was still alive .
mother had always told me he had died in the war .
I think she did this for my own good .
I was very be@@ m@@ used by the situation and did n&apos;t know if I liked him or not .
in my dreams I had seen him as an intellectual but now he was in my sitting room and he looked like an elephant or something exotic .
it was very odd to see him in my home .
now we all live together .
although the first days were difficult , now we all get on well .
it is great to be a whole family again .
the Grand Place is the central square of Brussels .
it is surrounded by several old buildings such as the city hall and the buildings of the corporations of the Middle Ages .
these were groups of people doing the same work , such as carpen@@ ters .
they helped each other and the elders ones taught the youngsters .
sometimes , they became very rich .
each building is decorated with the bla@@ zon of the corporation .
their architecture is unique and beautiful .
today , most of them are hosting cafés , shops and restaurants that attracts a lot of tourists , but there is also the city museum .
the square is covered with pavement and is a pedestri@@ anized area .
it is an important place for the history because it is the oldest Grand Place of Europe and it is a part of the oldest neighbourhood of Brussels which is made of narrow paved streets , old and high buildings and , among other things , chocolate shops .
recently , several of the buildings have been restored and we can now better see their beautiful g@@ il@@ ding and carvings .
every year , when Christmas comes , there is an amazing show with music and lights on the fa@@ ç@@ ades of the buildings while a huge f@@ ir tree is placed in the centre of the square .
Wawel Royal Castle is one of the highest ranked monuments in the history and culture of Poland and Europe , so during the stay in Poland it is necessary to visit it .
the first Castle , called pal@@ ati@@ um , was built in 11th century , the remains of it are still visible inside the walls .
during the next centuries it was expanded , and in 16th century finally rebuilt in a Ren@@ aissance fashion , which remained unchanged until today - the most representative rem@@ nant is probably famous ar@@ ca@@ ded courtyard .
during the tour the visitors are shown several room and apartments , as well as Royal Private apar@@ tam@@ ents with far - fam@@ ed tap@@ est@@ ries of Polish &apos; kings collection .
another attraction of the tour is visiting the Cr@@ own T@@ reas@@ ury , where Polish cor@@ on@@ ation in@@ sig@@ nia were stored , and arm@@ our@@ y .
apart from the featured , there are also many marvellous exhibitions in the Castle containing its history as well as the other collections .
while visiting Wawel Royal Castle one can not omit seeing Dragon &apos;s D@@ en - a cave under the Castle , where , according to the oldest legends , the dragon of Wawel lived .
I recommend visiting Wawel Royal Castle because of its beauty and uniqu@@ eness .
it is a symbol of a thousand years of the Polish history and culture .
everyone will find something interesting among the variety of exhibitions and tours , and for certain it will be a memorable experience .
I have been learning English as a second language since I was ten years old , which means a very long time ago .
I think I am very lucky then because I have had the opportunity of learning English in a natural way , without books and tough lessons .
my teachers thought it was better to learn by speaking , singing , and doing other activities in English , in a way similar to how we learn our own mother language .
moreover , I travelled to England and lived with English families for a few weeks every summer since I started learning until I was fifteen years old .
so I grew up thinking I could speak and write quite good English .
even though I do have little theoretical knowledge about English grammar rules , I can make myself understood in a normal conversation , and I can write an email to a friend without making too many mistakes .
one year ago I decided to take the Cambridge Advanced English exam in order to test my knowledge , thinking It would be not very difficult for me to be successful .
I decided to enrol for a creative writing course in order to practise my writing skills .
along the course I had to accomplish some writing assignments and submit them to be evaluated by my peers .
and there I realised at least two things : the first one that it is possible to learn how to write better ; the second one that even when you can make yourself generally understood , It is not so easy to be precise .
a magician uses a dove and a black hat , but it would n&apos;t be a magic show if he did n&apos;t know how to perform the trick .
in the same way I had the ideas and the words but I had to admit that I needed to learn the rules of grammar if I wanted to do the magic trick of precise and stylish writing .
adolescence .
everybody say it &apos;s the best period in our whole life ; what they do n&apos;t remember is that it could be also the worst .
adolescence could be compared to a foggy path and even when it seems you can see something threw it , in reality you do n&apos;t .
this awful fog is composed by our un@@ controlled emotions .
everything is unknown , but we try to pretend that we know a lot of things .
this could be one of the reason why we get angry so easily and so often with our parents : every time we discover something new or we say something , they judge us or they begin some long speeches to try to change our ideas .
another thing about the relationship between parents and adolescents is the fact that they confuse our minds .
as I said adolescents could be very confused and if there &apos;s a thing that get under our skin is when moms say something and then tell us to do the opposite one .
the worst part is that they get angry with us !
we &apos;re confused , they &apos;re not clear and then they also get angry and they &apos;re surprised when we get mad at them !
it &apos;s true that we should always be respectful but sometimes it turns out to be impossible because they do everything to provo@@ ke us .
I think the most important thing in the relationship with our parents is to find a sort of accordance , because in the end we do n&apos;t only feel anger for them but also a lot of love .
love : that &apos;s a new feeling that adolescents have to face .
it &apos;s not the usual love they &apos;re used to feel , as love for family and friends , but it &apos;s a new kind of love .
it &apos;s a kind of love that struggles ; it makes butterflies fly in our stomach , it makes us dive into a sort of imaginary tale .
that kind of love that we see in movies and we dream of ; the type of love that does n&apos;t make us fall asleep at night .
it is a period in which we have our first experiences , and it is as scary as exciting .
adolescence it is like this , there &apos;s a moment that looks magical and in the following one you drown into the dark .
dear group leader ,
first of all , I would like to thank you for the interest shown to our small village .
I really hope that you have a nice welcome and , please , feel at home .
here , in M@@ all@@ or@@ ca , there are a lot of places to visit but I will recommend you a unique place , without tourists , noise and crowded beaches .
on the east of M@@ all@@ or@@ ca you will find a small and beautiful village called Ar@@ t@@ à .
in the municipality of Ar@@ t@@ à you will find a coaster town , situated on the edge of the mountain range of L@@ lev@@ ant .
sa Col@@ ò@@ nia de S@@ ant P@@ ere is a traditional fishermen village .
nowadays , you can still see some fishermen fishing on the seashore .
here your adventure starts .
in order to get to your destination you must ride a bicycle and just enjoy the splendid panor@@ amic view .
you will ride until Ca Los cans , one of the most en@@ ig@@ matic beaches of M@@ all@@ or@@ ca .
this zone is part of a protected area , a natural park .
for that reason , you must go riding a bike or walking .
as Mach@@ ado said &quot; se have Cam@@ ino al and ar &quot; .
it means that the most important is the way , the journey .
going on a bike near the seashore with the breeze of the sea is one of the most relaxing experiences in life .
on the way to Ca Los cans , you will see the typical Mediterranean vegetation .
there are a lot of trees called &quot; am@@ ar@@ ell@@ us &quot; , native trees of the coast of M@@ all@@ or@@ ca .
moreover , you will go between two ancient o@@ beli@@ s@@ ks which have been recently restored .
finally , you will get to Ca Los C@@ ans .
it is a special beach with stones instead of sand and surrounded by trees instead of hotels .
there you can practise different sports .
it is a perfect place to go diving because you can see different fishes , sea ur@@ ch@@ ins and seaweed .
there you can also take a can@@ oe and paddle in the quite sea .
a part from sports , you should note two different culture points .
on the one hand , there is what remains standing of certi@@ fications that were used to keep the small boats of the local fishermen save from storms .
on the other hand , there is a pre@@ historical tower called &quot; Tal@@ ai@@ ot &quot; .
the function of the Tal@@ ai@@ ots is not clear yet .
maybe it was a def@@ ensive tower or an important building for high - class people .
it is important to stay in the beach until the sun goes down .
the sunset in that place is ideal and romantic ( especially if you are with your partner ) and you will see how the sun goes behind the mountain range of T@@ ram@@ un@@ t@@ ana .
from that seashore you can see all the Al@@ c@@ ú@@ dia bay , part of the mountain range of T@@ ram@@ un@@ t@@ ana and the cap@@ e of For@@ mentor .
ca Los C@@ ans is a mixture of sea , nature and culture .
I am sure that you will like it and , of course , I need to ask you a favour : please , keep the secret .
regards ,
Paula .
introduction .
the aim of this report is to outline the best and the worst qualities of your centre after one year running .
this report analyses the two main facilities : the gym and the swimming pool .
the gym .
the machines are fantastic and the staff is very helpful with every customer .
on the other hand , the gym is too small .
every afternoon it is crowded so it is very difficult to do exercise .
the swimming pool .
it is ideal for people who do not compete because of its length , about 20 metres .
furthermore , it is not too deep , so it is excellent for people who want to learn how to swim .
on the other hand , the changing rooms are too far from this facility , so it is easy to catch a cold when someone goes from one place to another .
conclusions .
the facilities are quite modern and the staff are excellent but the gym could be bigger .
furthermore , you would put heaters to avoid colds in the passage way from the changing rooms to the swimming pool .
the Future of Public Transport
when we imagine future , we rarely imagine overcrowded buses and rusty subway trains .
as technologies develop and become cheaper more and more people buy personal cars .
a car allows us to move faster and not to depend on others .
Trav@@ alling by car is also much more convenient .
does this all mean that the years of public transportation come to an end ?
in my opinion , it is not true .
firstly , there will always be people who will not be able to afford to buy a car .
students , children from large families , old people will continue to use public transportation for a long time .
secondly , cars can also turn into public transport .
science fiction often depicts future as the world where cars are used freely .
anyone can use the nearest car he or she sees .
Thirdly , people do not have an inborn driving skill , so even in the future children and teenagers will need public transportation .
this is also true for older people , who lose the ability to drive as they age .
in conclusion , public transportation is not likely to disappear , at least during the nearest tens of years .
the chart above gives some information about the average monthly salaries of nurses and doctors in four different countries .
according to the chart , the two countries with the lowest salaries are Country A and Country B.
these ones are called &quot; source countries &quot; , which means that they provide a supply of health care workers to other countries .
otherwise , the countries with the highest salaries are country C and country D. Differ@@ ently from the first two countries , these ones are called &quot; destination countries &quot; because the health care service is provided by foreign and qualified workers .
moreover , in the first three countries doctors earn about twice as much as a nurse earns , apart from the last country , Country D. In this one , the salary gap between doctors and nurses is bigger than in other countries .
in Country D , the salaries of doctors are about three times higher than those of nurses .
in conclusion we can say that from the standpoint of the doctors and nurses , working abroad is a much better deal .
boxing is a common , well known and well loved sport amongst most countries in the world however it is also puni@@ shing , dangerous and disliked to the extent that many people want it banned , possibly with good reason .
boxing is a dangerous sport , there are relatively common deaths , tragic injuries and even disease .
all professional box@@ ers are at risk from being killed in his next fight .
if not killed then more likely paraly@@ sed .
there have been a number of cases in the last ten years of the top few box@@ ers having tragic losses throughout their ranks .
this is just from the elite few , and there s more from those below them .
more deaths would occur through boxing if it were banned .
the sport would go underground , there would be no safety measures like gloves , a doctor , parame@@ dic@@ s or early stopping of the fight if someone looked unable to continue .
with this going on the people taking part will be dangerous , and on the streets .
dangerous dogs who were trained to kill and ma@@ im in similar underground dog fights have already proved deadly to innocent people , the new box@@ ers could be even more at risk .
once boxing is banned and no - one grows up knowing it as acceptable there will be no interest in boxing and hopefully less all round interest in violence making towns and cities much safer places to live in , there will be less fighting outside pubs and clubs and less violent attacks with little or no reason .
change the rules of boxing slightly would much improve the safety risks of the sport and not de@@ tract form the entertainment .
there are all sorts of proposals , lighter and more cushi@@ oning gloves could be worn , ban pun@@ ches to the head , head@@ gear worn or make fights shorter , as most of the serious injuries occur in the latter rounds , these would all show off the box@@ ers skill and talent and still be entertaining to watch .
even if a boxer is a success and manages not to be seriously hurt he still faces serious consequences in later life diseases that attack the brains have been known to set in as a direct result of boxing , even Mu@@ ham@@ ed Ali , who was infamous ( ? ) both for his boxing and his quick - wit@@ ted intelligence now has Alzheimer disease and can no longer do many everyday acts .
many other sports are more dangerous than boxing , motor sports and even mountaine@@ ering has risks that are real .
box@@ ers chose to box , just as racing drivers drive .
in many of the minority works of modern literature , there can be some emphasis on re@@ bel@@ lion against oppressive forces .
although such a show of strength by these works &apos; characters is sometimes viewed as a violent and therefore negative contribution to the otherwise in@@ sight@@ ful thought of the author , it is this conflict upon which many stories of ethnic American literature are based .
however , such a re@@ bel@@ lion can not be seen clearly in each minority work , and , therefore , the products of ethnic American literature can not be categorized as merely the result of years of oppression .
rather , this ever - changing and ever - challenging aspect of minority literature creates an especially important necessity that each work be considered individually as both a product of years of struggle and a work inher@@ ently distinct from any other .
in the minority works , the conflict and re@@ bel@@ lion presented accurately reflects society as a whole , and although the mother &apos;s in The Joy Luck Club re@@ bel against such forces as arranged marriages , T@@ ita in Like Water for Chocolate fights to overcome old family traditions , and the Indian tribes in Love Medicine struggle to secure their inherent rights from the US government , the characters &apos; conflicts reflect similar conflicts of other cultures .
re@@ bel@@ lion is seen not as a distinct force in minority cultures , but rather as a binding force between all cultures , for Ce@@ lie , too , resi@@ sts her arranged marriage in The Color Pur@@ ple , and the murder@@ ous loves in Jazz reflect T@@ ita and Pedro &apos;s destructive passion in Like Water for Chocolate .
re@@ bel@@ lion and conflict are emphasized in ethnic American literature , but they are portrayed no more strongly in minority works than they are portrayed in other pieces of literature .
emphasis changes with each work , and although figures of authority are particularly oppressive in works such as Like Water for Chocolate and The Color Pur@@ ple , other minority works including Love Medicine and Jazz do not reflect the clearly defined author@@ it@@ arian figures nor the obvious re@@ bel@@ lion of the characters &apos; respon@@ sive action which the previously mentioned works show .
this again implies that these ethnic American pieces of literature can not be categorized as merely re@@ belli@@ ous responses to oppression , but as individual reflections of personal and cultural experiences .
how does Vol@@ ta@@ ire tackle the question of philosophical optimism in &apos; Candi@@ de &apos; ?
philosophical optimism -@@ l@@ &apos;@@ opti@@ mis@@ me@@ - is the philosophy that everything and occurrence is for some good .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire sets out in Candi@@ de to critici@@ se this philosophy .
in Candi@@ de the representative of this philosophy is P@@ ang@@ loss , the philosopher employed at Thunder - der - Tr@@ on@@ cks .
the whole book is a criticism of l@@ &apos;@@ opti@@ mis@@ me .
for example when Candi@@ de is forced to join the bul@@ gar army he is beaten almost to death but Candi@@ de does not concern himself because he know it is for his own good - in fact later in the book he uses his training to become a soldier .
although this would seem to be good it is not because of his training he kills two men , a J@@ ew and an arch@@ bi@@ shop with no hesitation and then proc@@ eeds to kill his swee@@ the@@ arts brother .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire show his dislike of l@@ &apos;@@ opti@@ mis@@ me when P@@ ang@@ loss , Candi@@ de and James are caught in a bad storm at sea in which James is drowned and there are only three survivors , Candi@@ de , P@@ ang@@ loss and a sailor .
the storm was caused by an earthquake which destroys the city to which Candi@@ de was sailing to .
on arrival they see starvation and death .
Candi@@ de is obviously horrified , especially when the sailor begins pill@@ aging the city .
Candi@@ de looks to P@@ ang@@ loss for an answer but P@@ ang@@ loss can only tell him that some good will come of it .
Candi@@ de , although remaining true to the ideals of optimism , always appears to be sc@@ ep@@ tical of it .
this is no more true than when he arrives in the new world , South America , and has to leave his darling Cun@@ é@@ gon@@ de with the Com@@ mission@@ er of the province .
Candi@@ de can not see what possible good can come of this especially as the reason that he was in America was due to him killing the J@@ ew and arch@@ bi@@ shop because they were Cun@@ é@@ gon@@ de &apos;s lovers .
throughout the book we begin to see how Candi@@ de is gradually lead away for l@@ &apos;@@ opti@@ mis@@ me or perhaps more importantly how l@@ &apos;@@ opti@@ mis@@ me is shown to be the philosophy of despair .
the constant belief that good can come from bad is not actually inspiring but leads to a constant flow of disasters .
Candi@@ de &apos;s life , in the book , appears to show this .
he is thrown out of Thunder - den - Tr@@ on@@ ck because he embr@@ aces Cun@@ é@@ gon@@ de , he is du@@ ped into the army , he is caught in an earthquake , he is almost killed as part of an auto - da - f@@ é , he kills three chur@@ ch@@ men , he is almost eaten , he finds E@@ ld@@ or@@ ado but leav@@ es@@ - the list continues .
Candi@@ de &apos;s life is governed by his belief the good will prev@@ ail .
eventually , of course , he does marry Cun@@ é@@ gon@@ de but she is not the beautiful young flower that he once loved .
she has become ugly and grew worse by the day .
this illustrates empha@@ tically the fol@@ ly of l@@ &apos;@@ opti@@ mis@@ me .
Candi@@ de has travelled the world in search of Cun@@ é@@ gon@@ de , with the hope that he will marry her despite all the trouble which he has gone through , of course in the end he does get Cun@@ é@@ gon@@ de but at the price of her looks and personality .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire , in Candi@@ de , shows how the philosophy of Op@@ ti@@ mism is one of despair not hope .
it would be tempting to think of the various European Comm@@ unities as an embr@@ y@@ onic United States of Europe ; especially when we hear politicians talk of the importance of European Un@@ ity .
however it is important to realise that Europe is a very long way from becoming anything like the United States .
when the original 13 American states resolved to form what is now the United States of America , they were intent on forming a political as well as economic entity .
they were prepared to yield as much of their own sovereignty as would be essential to allow the newly formed national government to operate as a single international political force .
a balance was therefore struck in the constitution to allow the individual states as much self - government as possible while ensuring that , for example in military matters , the central government spoke for all .
it is true that today one still hears the old dispute over state sovereignty and attempts to return some power to the individual states , but no - one would challenge the fact that , on matters external to the United States , the government in Washington represents the sole policy - making body .
in Europe it is quite clear that many people would like to see a political union of the countries since this would produce a formidable international military force .
however it is equally clear that while there might be some unified political action flowing from the European Comm@@ unities ( such as was seen over Europe &apos;s response to the British involvement in the F@@ al@@ k@@ land Islands dispute ) , the Comm@@ unities were intended as purely economic entities in the first place .
membership almost certainly involves some loss of national sovereignty , but the United Kingdom could probably leave the community by a simple majority vote in the Westminster Parliament , something which no state in the United States could law@@ fully do .
we are still a very long way from a Sing@@ le Parliament for Western Europe with power to make political decisions for all ; and even with 1992 approaching and a single market the gul@@ f between the UK and Europe is very wide .
the su@@ pre@@ macy of Parliament will never be challenged .
its ability to make and break any law - made by it or Europe - means that it re@@ tains full sovereignty .
even if today it made laws to that would unite it fully with Europe and rel@@ in@@ qui@@ sh its sovereignty for ever , it could tomorrow repe@@ al all those laws .
the fact that Parliament does not bind itself or can not be bound by any political body means that it can never lose its sovereignty unless a majority of the population wished it and Parliament consen@@ ted .
but with the average jin@@ go@@ istic Bri@@ ton there is no chance of us curing ourselves of our x@@ en@@ op@@ hobia and ever wishing to be fully integrated with Europe .
even now the channel tunnel has joined us to the continent we still consider ourselves to be separated from the world standing alone against a hostile world .
naturally , the problems of a single Europe would run as deeply as the benefits that we would presumably ultimately receive .
it seems to me that for the past few centuries , Britain has always considered itself to be detached from the rest of Europe .
whenever necessary , she has al@@ lied herself to European powers , such as in times of war of extreme distrust .
Britain has been eager to maintain a secure balance of power on the continent , but throughout history , she has been more concerned with her over@@ sees em@@ pires than with anywhere else .
in the latter half century though , her emp@@ ire has dimini@@ shed and she has had to face moun@@ ting responsibility in Europe .
because of her history of isolated sovereignty it is difficult to accept being a part of a single Europe .
for instance , British law is based largely upon prece@@ dent , that is judge made law .
we have established a system of law which dates back many centuries , and which is widely known and respected .
there is very little European influence on our law , of course in many respects it will be the same , but the lack of influence will display many differences .
with the creation of a single Europe , new law will have to be accepted throughout the continent , and it will cause both confusion and conflict .
the British tend to be very proud and possessive of the law , and changes may well cause feelings and dis@@ content .
of course , the same points will apply to the monetary system in Europe .
will there just be one system ?
the country typically is against major change and something as fundamental as money would cause problems if it was to be altered .
our individual monetary system I suppose , could be seen as a symbol of sovereignty .
it can be said that if a single Europe was created , problems may arise over its fundamental political concepts .
of course Britain would lose her sovereignty , as would the other nations of the union .
it has been suggested that the Sing@@ le Union could be based on a basic federal structure , whereby local autonomy could be saved , but the union as a whole could work together in a democratic manner .
to a certain extent , even if sovereignty was lost , some national personality would be preserved .
the fact is that , when united , European unity would still in essence be divided .
there will always be aspects of one society that the others will never accept .
Europe as a whole faces the same problems , and therefore , if a single Europe was created , un@@ iting Britain , the problems could be dealt with quickly and efficiently .
if the Feder@@ alists achieved their aims in a European unity , they would do their best to achieve democracy and promote it nationally , so that individuality is preserved , and that all of their positive features will be known .
the problem facing the British , really results from their isolated past .
the sovereignty of the nation has deep roots , and the fears of losing it are very great .
whether this would happen awaits to be seen , and would depend completely on the terms of the union , and the negoti@@ ations and feelings of the general public and the politicians leading the countries .
with 1992 now only a year away , the question of what a Sing@@ le Europe will mean for Britain becomes increasingly relevant .
I firmly believe that the advent of 1992 will result in a loss of sovereignty for Britain .
this loss need not however be negative .
in fact , in political , economic and defence terms I feel this re@@ allocation of resources can and will be very positive .
whilst to a certain extent I may be guilty of having an island mentality , I would n&apos;t go as far as to say Britain is in danger of handing all control over to fac@@ eless bureau@@ crats in Brussels or Str@@ as@@ bour@@ g .
throughout the world a wind of change is apparent , but especially so in Europe .
this process will continue and Europe the rest of the world will evolve with or without the participation of Britain in this process .
it is my belief that Britain must be involved in the decision making which will eventually decide the new world order .
however to be fully involved , sacrifices have to be made .
such sacrifices will involve certain aspects of our sovereignty .
in rel@@ in@@ qui@@ shing and thus centr@@ ali@@ sing certain powers , the aim is not to diminish the strength of individual nations but to increase the overall impact of Europe on the world stage .
as amp@@ ly demonstrated by recent events in the Gulf , European cooperation in the field of defence can be both impressive and effective . whilst I would be reluctant to hand over all control to defence to any central body .
I can see a future for some form of European rapid reaction force .
whilst to an extent crip@@ pling defence costs could be cut this would not necessarily lead to a reduction in the size of defence available .
in political terms , regardless of legislation , Britain like the rest of Europe is becoming increasingly cos@@ mop@@ olitan in terms of the population composition .
the North Sea will increasingly come to represent a mere pud@@ dle as people move between countries .
I feel it is important for Britain to join fully with its European partners to adapt to these changes in demo@@ graphy .
politically we are moving closer together .
possible problems should be studied and solved if possible before they happen .
E.@@ R.@@ M. is already upon us but in this area I feel Britain should be especially careful .
whilst not pretending to fully understand this system I do know that no system can lower interest rates , and inflation while raising growth , with the possible exception of the Magic Circle .
in the area of the single currency , again I feel this is inevitable .
what is important is to base this currency on the strong curr@@ encies within the EE@@ C as opposed to an average based system .
to conclude I would say a single Europe is already happening and that it will continue to do so is guaranteed .
Britain must not concern itself with loss of sovereignty but gain of the European equivalent .
if we miss the boat I think we will drawn before the next boat comes .
when the treaty of Rome was signed in 195@@ 7 , the foundation was laid for a new &quot; continent &quot; - a united Europe .
it was said that Europe would not be created quickly , but over several years .
when Britain entered the European Community in 1973 after a national referen@@ dum , the debate began concerning Bri@@ tains relationship with Europe .
when 1992 was set as the date for the single European Market , the debate fl@@ ared up again , but over how far Britain should be integrated .
the rest of Europe seems prepared for 1992 but Britain seems to be deci@@ de@@ dly hesitant .
the former Prime Minister , Margaret Tha@@ t@@ cher was not been to lead Britain into a United Europe because she felt it would lead to a loss of our sovereignty .
there is no doubt an integrated market would have multiple benefits for the countries involved .
businesses and other trading organizations are preparing themselves for 1992 , and the single market .
trade will be easier , with no fron@@ tier controls allowing free flowing transportation of merchandise .
there will be business bo@@ oms and free competition with the removal of protective practices , along with greater freedom to travel .
many Bri@@ tons would consider Europe has affected Britain too much already , with deci@@ m@@ alization , the new Euro - passports and now the pound ster@@ ling being tied to the EC@@ U .
they may feel Britain is being pulled into Europe .
further changes are forecast for Britain , effec@@ ting day to day matters , to create a &quot; European Standard &quot; .
this may make Bri@@ tons resent@@ ful of Europe and tired of &quot; 1992 and all that &quot; .
a single market requires one central institution to co - ordinate all movements of goods and policies .
will the people of Britain be prepared to give up their government and be directed from Str@@ as@@ bour@@ g or Brussels ? .
many people would not .
will the day come when the pound ster@@ ling is taken over by the EC@@ U ?
it may well - but will the Bri@@ tons have a chance to voice their opinions and views ?
Europe may argue that the benefits from a single integrated market would far outweigh any national drawbacks .
as the date draws nearer , the awareness of Bri@@ tons to Europe must increase .
they must look into the future and consider possible effects .
will Britain be drawn into Europe against its will ?
perhaps as more of Britain becomes &quot; Euro@@ fied &quot; , Bri@@ tons will wake up and see their sovereignty is being taken away .
Britain has never geograph@@ ically been a part of Europe .
we are in the EE@@ C and we should be able to benefit from free trade .
we have been an island for too long - being independent and able to stand alone .
we have a sound democratic process , which many people would not want to give this up .
a fully integrated market with Britain as a full member would be to the detri@@ ment of our political system and consequently leading to a loss of sovereignty .
there has been such a lot of talk about a Sing@@ le Europe in recent years that it is hard to believe that it will be upon us very soon .
now that it is a reality , and not just a probability , the question in the minds of many Bri@@ tons is indeed : will this mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain or the birth of a nation ?
firstly , a positive approach .
looking at things from an economic perspective , this is not a problem .
the benefits in terms of cost - cutting owing to doing things once , instead of twelve times , will be enormous .
firms , because of being able to pool their resources , will be able to devote more time to research and development , and thus products will improve .
Europe will therefore be a nation to be reck@@ oned with as regards competition .
to look at things on a more individual level , every member of the new Sing@@ le Europe &apos;s standard of living should increase .
a greater potential of ideas from a greater number of experts will , in theory , result in more knowledgeable and better - informed individuals .
simplicity is one of the Commission &apos;s key aims , with the idea that if things are simpler and more easy for everyone to understand people will be happier , get on better .
if this is so , they should also work better .
ideally then , there should be more equality , less crime , greater productivity and greater economic growth .
on the other hand , will this Sing@@ le Europe mean a loss of sovereignty for Britain ?
it must be remembered that not only does Britain have a small population compared to the majority of the other member states , but it is an island - which none of the others are .
why should this matter ?
well , Britain has quite a history and therefore a fair number of traditions .
it is possible that it could become eng@@ ul@@ fed in the new Sing@@ le Europe and lose its identity .
Bri@@ tons ( especially those from older generations ) may then feel &quot; lost &quot; and that they do not really &quot; belong &quot; any more .
the new Sing@@ le Europe may be too new and unknown for them to make their alle@@ gi@@ ance to it .
then there is the question as to whether all this ide@@ alism really will work .
will there be greater prosperity , better - informed , happier citizens , or will this never come off because of politicians being unable to agree on policies ?
Britain , although small , is more often than not in the fore of international matters , taking a definite stance on what it considers to be right .
has it then not got quite a lot at stake , its character at least , in integrating itself into this Sing@@ le Europe ?
no one would dispute that this is a difficult question .
the fact remains however that next year ( in 1992 ) there is going to be a Sing@@ le Europe .
this , as everyone is well aware , is not going to be achieved with ease , but the more tolerant every member state is of each other , the more successful the Sing@@ le Europe will be .
it is up to Britain therefore to accept this fact and to show an example by leading the way as regards tolerance .
then we will all be able to look at the future in a more positive way .
the European Community is a unique grou@@ ping of twelve sovere@@ ign European Member States who are committed to the development of closer economic and political co - operation .
the community has an aim to break down the economic and political barriers that have traditionally divided Europe .
in particular , the community seeks to facilitate greater movement within its fron@@ ti@@ ers ; movement not only of goods but of services , capital and people .
however , the issue of sovereignty is certainly a much debated one ; to what extent should a member hand over its sovereignty to the Community , if at all ?
let us look at the foun@@ ding of the European Community , before we discuss the issue of sovereignty in more detail .
there were several attempts at peaceful uni@@ fication after the First World War , but only after Europe had again been devastated by war was the fu@@ tility of national rivalry truly apparent .
the political and economic exhaustion of the European states called for a fresh start and a far more radical approach to the re - ordering of Europe .
this fresh start came about because of three main factors .
firstly , was Europe &apos;s realization of her own weakness , after having lost her age - old position at the centre of the world stage to the United States of America and to the Soviet Union .
these super@@ powers were economically , milit@@ arily and politically stronger than the divided individual European states .
secondly was the convic@@ tion that military conflict should in the future be avoided ; after all , the two great wars had both begun as European &quot; civil wars &quot; . Thirdly was the common desire for a better , fre@@ er world in which international relations would be conducted in a more orderly way .
one of the first major moves towards European integration was the creation of the European Economic Community , in 195@@ 8 .
its membership has grown from the ten original founder countries to twenty - three .
one of the most innovative features of the European Community compared with other international bodies is that the member states have ce@@ ded to it a part of their national sovereignty and end@@ owed it with its own sovere@@ ign powers , which it can use to adopt acts , having the force of national law .
this novel approach to pooling national sovereignty is called &quot; integration &quot; .
the 1970 &apos;s saw progress in integration , with the introduction of community policy instruments , which enabled greater scope for national policies .
all of the member states agree in principle to the idea of a single market by 1992 , however each wish their own interests to be safe@@ guar@@ ded .
this is to say that none want to sacrifice their national sovereignty , many want un@@ anim@@ ous voting , not majority voting .
many see this issue as a threat to their own regulations and laws , and could foresee a drop in standards if they do not stand firm .
the situation is seen as a threat to the countries in question who do not wish to bol@@ dly give up their sovereignty for the sake of European unity .
whether or not the continuation of the progress in the field of European unity is successful depends very much on the people of Europe .
if a feeling of European unity develops and can be sustained , the threat will sub@@ side as a feeling of identity takes over .
on Bri@@ tains roads there is an ever increasing volume of traffic .
the road network is no longer able to carry this traffic without hold - ups and traffic jams ..
to remedy this the government has started adding a fourth lane on some stretches of our motorways and constructing ring roads and by@@ passes , with mixed reception .
while the road system is being improved there seems to be an endless series of road@@ works which restrict the highways and cause further delay while the road@@ works are in place .
the inability to cope with the amount of traffic by the road system obviously increases the risk of drives having an accident and the drivers have to be constantly alert as they are nearly always in capacity traffic .
it might seem an easy solution to this may@@ he@@ m would be to use public transport ; i.e. the Rail@@ ways .
people are not taking to the R@@ ail system because of its lack of integration due to the recent priv@@ ati@@ sation of different areas .
it has been shown that different companies charge different fares for exactly the same route !
the main disadvantage with the railways is as the rail service and the bus service are normally owned by different companies it is probable that it is not possible to walk onto a bus off the train .
if the services were integrated there would be a bus time table which coinci@@ ded with the train arrival times .
then people would be more likely to catch the train as they would not have to look forwards to a long walk , wait for a bo@@ s or an expensive taxi ride .
my solution to the problem would be to improve the rail system and its related bus services , this would get people of the roads and onto the trains .
to improve the rail service trains have got to be tim@@ ed to arrive and depart at key times i.e. arrive at eight o&apos;clock and leave at half past six .
the train and bus companies have to li@@ aise with each other and the train fares have to remain relatively cheap i.e. the same price or less as it would cost to go by car .
the basic dilemma facing the UK &apos;s rail and road transport system is the general rise in population .
this leads to an increase in the number of commuters and transport users every year , consequently putting pressure on the UK@@ s transports network .
the biggest worry to the system is the rapid rise of car users outside the major cities .
most large cities have managed to encourage commuters to use public transport thus decreasing major congestion in Ru@@ sh hour periods .
public transport is the obvious solution to to the increase in population if it is made cheep to commuters , clean , easy and efficient then it could take the strain of the overloaded British roads .
for commuters who regularly travel long distances rail transport should be made more appealing , more comfortable and cheaper .
Motor@@ ways and other transport links are constantly being extended , widened and slowly turning the country into a concrete jungle yet it is only trying to cope with the increase in traffic , we are our own enemy !
another major problem created by the mass of vehicle transport is the pollution emitted into the atmosphere damaging the ozone layer , creating smog and forming acid rain . T@@ our@@ turing the Earth we are living on .
in conclud@@ ing I wish to propose clean , efficient comfortable and cheap public transport for the near future .
the modern traffic jam is now a familiar situation to nearly all of the western worlds population .
if every time we use our cars to travel any distance we find ourself in a 10 mile tail - back why do we still insist that that we travel in such a mean@@ der .
to illustrate my point , if every time you took a train , it stops for 2 hours on the track , everyone would stop taking it .
so why do we still insist on travelling on the road .
the answer most likely lies in 2 areas , first the attitude of many westerners is that &quot; it is their right to travel in such a manner &apos; .
this is in my opinion , shows considerable ignorance .
I am by far and away no &apos; greedy &apos; who wants to make everyone live in tip@@ i &apos;s and eat so@@ ya bean soup , however I do agree that something should be done about the volume of traffic that is on our roads today .
the governments answer to the considerably growing amount of traffic on our roads it just to back move , they are not even attempting to treat the cause , then more and more people are now driving .
we all feel that we have a divine right to be on the road .
why ?
do we , the western world ( 5% of the population of the world ) , have the right to use the resources of the rest of the world at the environmental cost ?
just because we can not be bothered to get out of bed a bit ear@@ il@@ ene to catch public transport .
even if we did , then shortly so does the rest of the world .
that could have disastrous implications .
the 2nd reason , is the problem that the public transport service , for example rail , is declining so much , there is no train to catch in the morning .
people stopped using trains because of the fall in standards , these people were forced onto the road , routes became un@@ profitable and so were closed and services cut back , forcing more people onto the roads .
the whole system has now formed a spir@@ aling circle of road use .
this has now been intensi@@ fied with the sale of the railways , to private rail company , profit motivated .
the vital , small rail links may now be closed , previously they where subsidi@@ sed to make up the loss , now the private companies can not afford to do this so many will close , cutting off small towns and villages .
the only way to stop the circle will be to break it , the only people to do this is the government or ourselves , If we make the effort to use public transport it will expand into a good service ; Un@@ fortun@@ atly the public se@@ am to be ap@@ a@@ thetic to this idea .
today , boxing has become a very popular sport , with T.@@ V. channels competing for coverage of certain events and fighters earning a lot of money , this is a big business .
apart from athletics , boxing seems to be the only popular international sport from which Britain can still hold to head high .
we have superb fighters with excellent character such as Len@@ no@@ x Lewis , Ni@@ gel ben@@ n , Na@@ shee@@ m H@@ amed and our beloved Frank Bruno .
despite being enjoyable to watch , boxing is very dangerous .
blows to the head can cause the brain to r@@ attle about the sk@@ u@@ ll which may cause a brain cl@@ ot or tumor .
last year , the fight between Chris Eu@@ bank and Micheal Watson led to calls for boxing to be banned when Micheal Watson slipped into a coma and was in a critical condition for some months .
many youths in low income areas see boxing as &apos; a way out &apos; , a chance to make it to the top and earn a lot of money on the way .
there are , however , people who regard boxing as bar@@ bar@@ ic , brutal and pri@@ mitive .
these people argue that there is no need for boxing and that it only promotes violence .
during the fight , yes , of course it is violent , but this is controlled violence and fighters have a mutual respect for each other .
all precautions are taken to ensure a safe fight .
during fights doctors a kept close to the ring and have the authority to call it off prematurely if required .
ambul@@ ances are also kept on stand by at big events .
although it may sound cruel , I do not believe that any fighter has entered a professional boxing career without knowing the risks .
because there are so many bu@@ dding young box@@ ers , to ban boxing would be insane , since it would almost certainly go underground .
underground fights are far more dangerous since less protective gear is used and there usually is n&apos;t a doctor present .
taking this into account and considering that boxing is about hurting the opponent , it can be said that boxing is a relatively safe sport .
although far less popular , there are other sports which are far more brutal and dangerous , such as &apos; Thai Bo@@ xing &apos; , where competitors are encourage to use their knees and elbows .
the argument continues , but for the sake of safety in the long term I do not think boxing will be banned .
which is good news for the majority of the British public .
two men , one ring , only one can leave . dramatic it may be but basically that is the main principal of boxing .
although throughout the years rules have been made to dilu@@ te the sports sa@@ di@@ stic side , should boxing be banned ?
every time a boxer gets punched in the head his brain moves vigorously inside his sk@@ u@@ ll .
this causes the boxer to lose many brain cells per boxing fight and if this occurs frequently then the boxer can end his career with brain damage .
in my eyes and probably the eyes of others this is reason enough for the banning of boxing .
the sport to say the least is actually a blood sport , the simple reason being that the idea of the sport is to &apos; knock your opposition out &apos; , although this is argued by Chris Eu@@ bank he believes he is a sportsman and the idea of boxing is an art form , he says that he does not specifically go into a boxing ring to knock his opponent out but to win on points differences and to give Chris Eu@@ bank his just respect most of his fights have been won on points .
but there is one exception - the original example , the first reference why boxing should be banned , the tragic accident where Michael Watson was put into a coma by Chris Eu@@ bank ( the man who does n&apos;t specifically go into fights to knock his opposition out ) .
this example only proves too well what a dangerous so called &apos; sport &apos; boxing is .
the boxing feder@@ ation is trying to do as much as it can to make the &apos; spot &apos; safer having r@@ ing@@ side doctors , banning bare hand fights but the top and bottom of the argument is that any blow to the head causes considerable damage .
there is always much speculation over the dangers of such a brutal sport as boxing .
this is emphasi@@ sed and exaggerated when a competitor in the sport trag@@ ically dies .
a recent death in the ring has inevitably led to a public u@@ pro@@ ar on the safety of the sport , and the controversy over whether the sport should be banned or not is yet again the fore@@ front of discussion .
let us consider how a professional boxer would feel .
he is clearly aware of the dangers and bru@@ tal@@ ism of the sport , which is possibly why he enjoys it so much .
I have yet to hear any boxer regret his choice of career .
the excitement of being in the ring , the joy at knocking an opponent onto the can@@ v@@ ass , and all the money that is there to be made are overwhelming factors which keep box@@ ers fighting .
the money that is there for the taking for the very best of the best is ridiculous , and with some top box@@ ers earning sums of money such as £ 20 million ( or in Mike T@@ ys@@ ons comeback case , $ 60 million ! ) it is hardly surprising how important the sport can be to some .
let us consider &apos; Sky &apos; viewers , recently beginning a subscription to view T@@ ys@@ ons &quot; next Live Lights &quot; .
this member of the public does not want the sport to be banned either .
now let us consider the friends or family of a boxer , who has been permanently injured ( or been killed due to a fight ) .
these individuals and others learning about the tragic incident in the media protest against the sport .
the family , who were originally against the idea of their son finishing college early to take up the sport would be leading the protests against boxing .
how pleased , proud and patriotic the British public felt when Frank Bruno achieved his ultimate goal and became the heav@@ y@@ weight champion of the world , yet how sorry many were to see him return to boxing after his head injuries earlier in his career .
this hypo@@ critical view is sho@@ ved by so many that whether boxing should be banned or not will remain a controversial issue for the fores@@ ee@@ able future .
there were 2 main objections raised against the introduction of the national lottery .
the first was the objection that the lottery would be little more another form of taxation , in fact , none than that , a tax on the poor .
the second and main objection came from ch@@ arities who predicted that charitable donations would go down with the introduction of the lottery , as people would be less likely to give money to charity , instead buying a lottery ticket , with the excuse that some of the money spent buying the ticket would go to charity .
there was also some controversy over the awarding of the lottery organisation franchise , which eventually went to Cam@@ el@@ ot , which was not seen as the strongest con@@ tender for the bid : other companies or con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um promised to give more money to charity with lower running costs .
Richard Bron@@ son promised to give all of his profits to charity , but was rejected .
my personal objections to Cam@@ el@@ ot as the lottery organiser is that a large proportion of the con@@ sor@@ ti@@ um are American or foreign firms , for example IBM has a size@@ able stake in Cam@@ el@@ ot .
the British national lottery run by non British firms .
since its introduction there has been more controversy over the national lottery .
when it promised to give 45 p@@ ence in every pound to charitable causes , it neglected to promise that most or all of this money would go to charity .
there has also been some controversy over the allocation of money .
for example 3 million pounds were given to E@@ ton college one of the richest public schools for a gymnasium money was also given to the royal opera house .
the lottery seemed to be a reverse Robin H@@ ood : stealing from the poor to give to the rich .
the lottery has also suffered alle@@ gations that it is addictive , especially with the introduction of scratch cards .
it has been claimed that it is so addictive that people will spend all their available cash on lottery tickets , only to be disappointed .
it has been calculated that only 4 p@@ ence out of every pound received by the lottery goes to charitable causes , the rest is tax the prize fund , profits , and the so called ch@@ arities .
it has also been calculated that the chance of winning anything substantial is one in millions , ie highly unlikely .
it has also been alleg@@ ed that the jack@@ pot are too high most of the lucky winners have said themselves that the jack@@ pot had ruined their life , alien@@ ating them from friends and family .
in conclusion , I think that the lottery should be re@@ tain@@ ed , but not in its present form . I think that jack@@ pot should be c@@ apped at 2 million pounds , and the prize fund shared between more people : it is better to give for teen people a fortune than to give fourteen fortunes to one person .
I would also remove any American business interests and give the charity money to more deser@@ ving &apos; charity &apos; .
now the lottery is in place , it would be very difficult to remove it from society .
the computer has been one of the most influential inventions of all time .
computers now dominate the majority of government business , science and communication , as well as many other areas of human life .
in many ways , it has taken the place of the human brain in performing calculations and thought processes .
the most obvious example of this is the calculator , an instrument used by mathema@@ tici@@ ans and scientists for making numer@@ ical calculations .
this has made it no longer necessary for the human to perform calculations and run through equations , and so need not understand the principles behind them any longer .
this , unfortunately , means that the genius scientist is being replaced by the powerful computer and its operator , who needs only to know which buttons to press .
this may seem an extreme view , as there is still much in the world of maths and science which a computer can not calculate , but this may not be the case centuries into the future .
computers have been used as a means of keeping records , they have all but super@@ se@@ ded handwritten text , ( in a few decades people may well be faced with a computer screen and keyboard in their General Studies exam ) , they are used to transfer money across the globe , even to create artwork and to entertain .
computer generated pictures , including &apos; Fr@@ act@@ al &apos; pictures , drawn from equations , seem to be more popular than hand printed images from an artist &apos;s imagination , and computer games seem to provide more entertainment than any game or activity that takes place in the real , physical world .
virtual reality allows people to have &apos; 3-@@ D &apos; entertainment created for them by a computer .
whether or not the computer is taking over from the human brain , it has certainly made the human body all but redundant .
people , businesses or corporations can be contacted at any point around the globe by fax machines , e - mail and the internet , and some people prefer these forms of communication to actually meeting face to face .
money can be transferred instantly without even needing to move the actual money - the physical co@@ in@@ age does n&apos;t matter , it is the computer records that state how much each bank has ownership of .
however , the idea that the human brain is no longer useful is not entirely true ( ! ) Computers can not deal with human beings , have no capacity for coping with anything outside their expected situations , and can not adapt to new situations using judgement .
human beings often act without logic or reason , and only other human beings can cope and deal with that .
also , computers can break down , and then a human is needed to take control - such as an airline pilot , and there are still certain tasks only a human being can perform , and they are often among the simplest .
they cried , they cheered .
their faces expressed joy , trium@@ ph , pride and perple@@ x@@ ity .
the world watched in anticipation -- We were mes@@ mer@@ ized by the images of the TV , expecting something new at every moment and not wanting to miss it -- I remember that day it was the only topic of conversation at school : &quot; have you heard ? &quot; , &quot; I ca n&apos;t believe it ! &quot; , &quot; After all this time ! &quot; , &quot; I never thought it would happen .
&quot; we all felt that we were living one of those historic moment that you read about in a history book and were proud to be a part of it -- It was November 9 , 1989 , the day that the Wall fell in Ber@@ lin@@ -
within a few weeks , the excitement had died down and people had turned their attention to more recent news .
but for me , this had been the start .
it was the start of what our now as - President Bush likes to refer to as &quot; our &quot; winning of the Cold War --
it was the event that gave the people of the Eastern Blo@@ c countries the hope that their efforts were not in vain -- For 40 years , the people had suffered under a communist regime that had not allowed them to express themselves freely or to leave their hom@@ el@@ ands in search of a new life -- Many people had tried to escape .
some had been executed -- I had a classmate whose father had escaped from Hungary -- He had left his family and friends , his whole life and had set out for Western Europe with little money .
I had asked him once if he had n&apos;t been scared , scared of what he would find once he left --
he told me that nothing could compare to the way he had been forced to live his life there -- Even though I had lost touch with this classmate , her father &apos;s words were with me as I watched the events un@@ fold in Germany --
bol@@ stered by the Germans &apos; success , the people of Hungary , T@@ che@@ k@@ os@@ lo@@ va@@ qui@@ a , Poland and R@@ ou@@ mania rose against communist reg@@ im@@ es as well -- Now , three years later , communi@@ sm as we once knew it no longer exists .
whether the people are happier or not , I can not say --
however , they will have at least seen the &quot; other side &quot; .
their struggles and hopes of forty years will not have been in vain -- Without the &quot; events of Berlin Wall &quot; history probably would not have taken a very different course -- Ev@@ ent@@ ually , I think that things would have turned out as they did --
however , history can not be re@@ written and as things stand the Fall of the Berlin Wall actively contributed to the re@@ sur@@ gence of hope and struggle in the rest of the Eastern Blo@@ c -- As such , it was the catalyst force that led to the end of the Cold War and therefore , though we may not always remember the other significant events , we will always remember the day the wall fell --
the development and implementation of technology has affected societies in every corner of the world .
I do not speak of a certain object in particular , but of technology as a whole .
this thing , technology has been and will always be both the closest friend and yet the greatest N@@ em@@ esis of our world .
science and technology have allowed me to travel to this part of the world , they have provided a living for my family , they have cured my grandmother of cancer , and they provide horizons of hope and knowledge in the fields of medicine , science , engineering , and even the less over@@ t corners of our lives .
the use of the means humans have developed is where@@ in the greatest problems lie .
alone , they do not threaten us , but when they become wel@@ ded with certain aspects of and certain people in our societies , they become potentially the most dangerous things that we hold in our hands .
speaking from my experience living in the United States , I have come to feel that technology has become a large detri@@ ment to our youth in particular .
people say that technological development has made our world much smaller ,
and I would con@@ cur that a great majority of Americans live in their own personal clos@@ ets .
in schools , Geography classes rarely , if ever , exist .
before I came to Spain , a group of children asked me if Spain was in Michigan .
explaining that Spain was located across the ocean did not seem to improve their understanding of the layout of our world .
science and technology have had effects on the U.S. that can not be described , and I feel that its people have adopted the same &quot; I am a self - suff@@ ici@@ ent@@ - I do n&apos;t need any help &quot; type of mentality that will slowly destroy us .
our awareness of other people , other cultures , and other languages is very low on the priority list of our educators .
until I was 15 , I was unable to study any foreign language at all , and even at that time I had only one choice of langu@@ ag@@ es@@ - German .
since I was twelve , I had an intense desire to learn Spanish , and because of these circumstances , that I mentioned before , I had no choice but to wait until I was twenty years old to even begin to learn this language .
mine is not the only experience like this .
the effort of the United States has caused our minds to be heard , and a world that is growing while my country l@@ ags behind in its selfish self - satisfaction .
many people argue nowadays that , with the advent of computer technology , our mental arithmetic is poor and we are becoming a nation of couch potatoes .
it is true in a way , the development of portable calculating machines ( calcul@@ ators ) has meant that we no longer need to be able to work out sums in our heads , but at what cost ?
in many shops , the cashi@@ ers appear to be dumb@@ founded by the simplest of sums without the aid of their ti@@ lls .
in many areas , the skill of human judgement has been replaced by faster , more accurate , computers .
many people have had their job positions taken over by computers .
filing cab@@ ine@@ ts are becoming a thing of the past with computer dat@@ ab@@ ases .
but even such men@@ ial tasks as filing are good for us .
they encourage organisational skills and ti@@ d@@ iness .
when people talk about artificial intelligence ( AI ) , you hear many funny tales from people who are convinced that the computers are coming alive and will eventually rule us .
these are just the r@@ ant@@ ings of people who have nothing to do with computers and who do not realise that behind every computer is a programmer .
even &apos; artificial intelligence &apos; needs to be programmed .
human brains still work out how to build the computers , how to program them and , more importantly , how to control them .
as for making the human brain redundant computers can help to improve learning skills , they can teach , test and improve our linguistic skills .
reflexes are improved ( and this has been scientifically proven ) by playing computer games , the very same things that parents say turn their children into &apos; zom@@ bies &apos; .
we can expand our imagination and convert our ideas into computer simul@@ ated models , enabling us to design buildings and road networks .
the computer revolution has not made our brains redundant , it has opened up areas of them we never knew existed !
it is now the age of the computer .
almost everyone owns a computer or has access to one .
computers nowadays are a far cry from the one &apos;s in the past which filled whole rooms .
they are able to generate amazingly accurate graph@@ ical represen@@ tations and perform extremely difficult mathematical equations in just seconds .
computers have become a huge part of our lives in both the areas of work and education .
but are they such a good thing ?
when calcul@@ ators came along a drop in ability of students for mental arithmetic was obvious and now they are used for the simplest calculations .
the computer could do the same thing .
computers encourage laziness in the general public , why work out something yourself when the computer can do it for you .
this is very time saving and efficient but it is causing people to forget basic ideas .
for instance , spelling is no longer as important as it was you can simply use a &quot; spell check &quot; to correct your English , which is absurd .
for the youth of today computers offer links around the world and millions of facts and figures .
this could be argued to be educational .
however , this is killing the imagination of children and they spend hours sat at a keyboard tapping away in the do@@ om and glo@@ om of the house .
they should be out enjoying themselves and gaining experiences for themselves instead of reading about them on a flat screen .
it is said that you can meet people through computers and have &apos; relationships &apos; .
I find this pre@@ pos@@ ter@@ ous and people are losing the ability to communicate and form relationships .
computers can offer escape from the hum - drum routine of daily life by means of games but they are mind - num@@ bing and un - inven@@ tive .
there is however a more dangerous threat from computers , it is that they can do the work for man .
this could lead to high unemployment .
those people who work with computers for long periods of time every day face problems .
the repetition of tapping keys all day and staring at the screen can be harmful and not only that it is highly boring to do the same thing over and over again .
computers may be the future but what part will man have in this future .
there will be no need for people to go to school as they could be taught at home , people would hardly ever talk and the only career available would be for computer programmers .
I agree that computers are helpful but people should not live through their computers and be so reliant on them .
they should read books and live more in order to regain their lost imagination and sense of adventure .
also , in schools I feel that work should be done mainly by hand and calcul@@ ators and computers should only be used minim@@ ally in mathematics in order to stop the production of computer addicts and again have normal people .
there are many beneficial aspects of genetic manipulation .
these include : the er@@ osion of identification of harmful hereditary genetic disorders and the development of hybrid high - yield crops .
there can be no doubt that genetic manipulation and genetic engineering have had highly beneficial effects on many areas of society .
however , many people dislike or are preju@@ diced against , genetic manipulation .
partly this is a &apos; F@@ ear of the unknown &apos; ; something which t@@ amp@@ ers with the intrinsic components of plant and animal life is beyond comprehension for most people , and therefore provokes fear .
what people have also become aware of , is the immense power which genetic manipulation can give to certain individuals .
this has been very good to feed popular culture ( the film &apos; Jur@@ ass@@ ic Park &apos; being an obvious reference point ) .
there is also however , the very real possibility that the power of genetic manipulation could become the possession of un@@ controlled un@@ regulated individuals who could use it for &apos; evil &apos; purposes .
this then , is an argument against scientists bearing moral responsibility for their work .
anything in life can be mis@@ used .
whether it be a kitchen - knife used to st@@ ab someone , a car used to run someone over , or something as harmless as a pillow used to suffoc@@ ate .
everything in life , if mis@@ used , can have harmful effects and genetic engineering and genetic manipulation are no exception .
though the possible effects of genetic manipulation may be far larger than a kitchen - knife or car , this is purely a subjective view by present - day standards .
certainly we would not hold the makers of a car or kitchen - knife responsible for their misuse , and there is no reason why scientists should bear the major burden or responsibility if genetic manipulation is put to misuse .
the fundamental flaw in saying scientists must bear the major burden or moral responsibility for their work , is that if this had been applied universally for centuries , scientific research would never have taken place , and mankind would be without electricity , radi@@ os , quite simply , anything above the mud hut &apos; existence .
scientific research is not a corrupt , but an essential and natural part of the human condition for bet@@ tering itself .
the other fundamental flaw is assuming that individual scientists have responsibility , Science is a process of discovery rather than creation , ie .
no - one created genetic manipulation , the power of it was there to be discovered .
if one scientist does not make a discovery then another one will .
it is unfair to hold responsible the scientist on the fore front of human knowledge , who discovers something when another scientist in another part of the world may make the discovery independently afterwards .
the only argument for making scientists responsible for their work , is that quite often , and particularly in the case of genetic manipulation , it would need a scientist to misuse knowledge , and therefore they should be responsible .
while genetic manipulation is relatively new , it takes a scientist to carry it out , and therefore an individual scientist could be held responsible .
but , once genetic manipulation becomes common - place in the future , and it is not only the domain of scientists , the origin@@ als scientist who discovered genetic manipulation can not be held responsible for other &apos;s misuse of it .
there are many problems facing the Mon@@ archy .
some of them are listed below :
the divi@@ sions in their family and the fight between prince and the princes of Wales and the possibility of the divorce .
the other problem is that people say ( or think ) that they do not do anything but they are rich and also they do not pay any taxes .
another problem is that people think that Mon@@ archy is aboli@@ shing in many countries and many countries are re@@ public so Mon@@ archy should be abolished in this country too .
there are also arguments against aboli@@ shing the Mon@@ archy too .
for example many people like the royal family or they are honest people not like the politicians that always lay .
I think the royal family and Mon@@ archy is a a tradition in UK and anywhere in the world , UK is known by its royal family , so I do not think it should be abolished .
in the end I think if many people want the Mon@@ archy to be abolished a general election should be called and then see if Mon@@ archy should be abolished .
&quot; in Vit@@ ro fertili@@ sation &quot; is the fertili@@ sation of an egg in the laboratory ie . in a tubes .
the egg is taken from the mother and placed in an environment which will optimi@@ se the chances of fertili@@ sation by the sper@@ m from the father .
once fertili@@ sation has occurred the fertili@@ sed egg is implanted back into the mothers wom@@ b and from there on the pregnancy will be normal .
normally more than 1 egg is taken from the mother so that the eggs can be stored and used later if the pregnancy is successful or so that more than one can be fertili@@ sed at the same time to increase the chance of a successful pregnancy .
this usually leads to multiple births ie .
twins , tri@@ ple@@ ts etc .
there are people who are against this , saying it is not natural and is it fair to the child having started life in a test tube , as they believe life starts from the moment of conception .
there are ethics involved whereby who is given the treatment and who is n&apos;t ?
, at what age should the treatment not be given and is it justi@@ fiable to spend so much money on in vit@@ ro fertili@@ sation for one person when the same amount of money could be used to saves hundreds of lives by vaccination people against meas@@ les for example .
the people who are for this can argue by saying that it is the right of every person to have their own child .
women who would not normally be able to have children can now do so with in vit@@ ro fertili@@ sation .
through no fault of her own she could have a blocked fall@@ opian tube causing her to be unable to allow eggs down to the wom@@ b and it is only fair in helping her to have children .
technology has progressed quickly and in doing so ethics and practical guidelines have been left behind .
I therefore think it is necessary to have certain regulations ie .
1 . fertility treatment should not be given to post - men@@ opa@@ usal women .
the men@@ op@@ ause is the body &apos;s way of telling you that you are to old and your body is no long capable of bearing a baby .
last year there was a case of a post men@@ opa@@ usal woman who by lying about her age was given in vit@@ ro fertili@@ sation ( IV@@ F ) .
I do n&apos;t think this is fair or morally correct to the child since her mother would be claiming her pension when she was at primary school and her mother would probably die while the child was in her teens .... there should be a test that is given before ( IV@@ F ) is carried out to check the mother is not past the men@@ op@@ ause .
2 .
eggs should not be taken from aborted foet@@ uses .
the foet@@ uses will have been aborted for a reason for example : if it was the result of a rape or if it had con@@ gen@@ ital de@@ for@@ mi@@ ties .
there should be a guid@@ eline or law stating that eggs should only be taken from the mother and not from dead , foet@@ uses .
science has moved on dramatically since the C@@ 19th .
many new things have been invented and many things medic@@ ally have changed .
people in our modern times are now able to have liver , heart and even lung trans@@ plants , there are many complications but many are successful .
people are able to have a whole new blood supply if theirs lacks the sufficient requirements or , a bone mar@@ row transplant if the blood lacks white cells .
all the above are carried out on living people , but nowadays biological operations can be carried out on humans which are not even born .
bodies can start their days in a test tubes .
this is called &apos; in vit@@ ro fertili@@ sation &apos; .
this is when an egg is removed from a woman placed in a test tube and then sper@@ m is placed in to the test tube and the egg and sper@@ m f@@ use together .
the test tube is then incub@@ ated for a few weeks and when the fet@@ us is formed , the baby is then inserted back in to the mother .
the fet@@ us is left to grow and develop naturally .
this idea is extremely beneficial to married couples who have been trying for a baby but have been unsuccessful are able to have children .
an in vit@@ ro fertili@@ sation allows the baby to grow inside , which allows the mother and baby to bond and it would feel apart of her , this would not happen if the couple adopted .
what I do feel is ethically incorrect is when a woman who is post - men@@ opa@@ usal decides she wants a baby .
nature has already taken its course to tell her she is too old to have any children so why should she have one implanted into her .
it is not fair on the child because when it grows up and all its friends are playing with their 30 - 40 year old parents , its mother could be drawing her pension and I am sure she would not feel like playing with her child .
also the mother may die of old age before the child has led a full life and this would be unfair to the child .
the child may also have to look after the mother in her old age .
as the fet@@ us begins its life in a test tube , and the sper@@ m is selected , this means that the sex of the sper@@ m could also be selected .
the way the sex can be chosen is by using genetics .
the women has 2 X chromos@@ omes and the man has one X and a Y - chromos@@ omes .
the way in which the sex can be selected is that the egg is always X and the sper@@ m nuc@@ le@@ us can either contain an X or a Y chromos@@ ome .
the X chromos@@ ome sper@@ m is slightly heavier than the Y so they can be separated .
if the mother wants a boy Y sper@@ m is selected and if a girl X is selected .
this may lead to an increase in one sex , and a decline in the other .
as a result this would reduce the population as there would be less couples .
also what happens if most people the year you are born are men and you are a woman , this would be the unpopular sex .
science is progressing all the time , but is it for the best ?
the main reason for the people of Britain to stop eating beef at the moment is the threat of BS@@ B .
this is a vir@@ al disease that attacks the central nervous system which can be passed on through consuming the animal .
in cows it is commonly know as mad cow disease and by law any cow showing these signs must be destroyed and not sold for meat .
the problem is however the signs are not shown for a long time , this being a vir@@ al disease .
it can be passed on to humans through eating parts of the animal such as the brain which is affected and these parts are usually sold and put into fast foods such as beef burgers .
the rest of the meat however is relatively safe and eating , e.g. a steak offers very little chance of the disease being passed on .
however the British press has ignored this fact and blown the situation out of proportion considering only a very small number of people have died of the disease after a lifetime of eating beef .
another reason for the British people to stop eating beef is the push for veget@@ ari@@ anism , although this is a much smaller threat to the trade than the former point a@@ but BS@@ B .
these factors could have a considerable impact on the agricultural industry preventing the sale of British dairy livest@@ ock not only in Britain but for export as well .
with global communications as good as they are now , it could send a scare across the world about British Bee@@ f - indeed France and Germany already have restricted and some places banned the sale or import of British beef for fear of it &apos;s safety .
although British farmers have learned to diversity , D@@ airy farming and the sale of Bee@@ f products still forms the back@@ bone of British agriculture and would completely change the face of farming in Britain .
wether they switch to sheep or vegetable crops were made , substantial changes would be needed to change the situation .
people throughout the United Kingdom were , doub@@ tless shocked and perhaps upset by images in the national press and television news of cows who had contracted the disease bo@@ vine spon@@ gi@@ form ence@@ phal@@ opath@@ y , or B@@ SE .
the so - called &apos; mad cow disease &apos; seemed to make the cows lose all sense of balance and direction , stum@@ bling around dr@@ unk@@ enly .
her@@ ds where this disease was found were put down before the symptoms progressed further .
those cows which had been put down were not used for food .
the disease inf@@ ects the cow , and is then present in the spinal fluid within the spine and the brain , and as the spinal fluid is usually sp@@ ilt in the sl@@ aughter of cattle for meat , the risk of contamination of the meat was one the industry was not willing to take .
the human disease , Cr@@ ent@@ z@@ feld - Jacob disease , or C@@ J@@ D , is believed to be a human form of B@@ SE , although no clear link has yet been established between the two .
it is unclear whether inci@@ dence of C@@ J@@ D is on the rise , or whether awareness of the condition is he@@ igh@@ tened , but more cases , from all ages have been diagnosed recently , and the disease is always fatal .
the government insists , perhaps correctly , that British beef is perfectly safe to eat .
however , people are genuinely scared of the presence of the disease in the U.@@ K. , and many are ab@@ st@@ aining from eating beef .
many schools have removed beef from their menus , substitu@@ ting pork and chicken , and sales of beef have shown a decline .
the implications for the beef industry could be rather serious , where everybody to boycot@@ t beef products .
to compensate , beef prices have dropped , in attempts to sell more meat , but the public remains sc@@ ep@@ tical .
if beef continues to fall from favour , then the beef industry &apos;s future would be unclear .
beef products are present in many food@@ stuffs such as j@@ el@@ lies , fruit g@@ ums , and of course stock cu@@ bes .
would all these products have to find synthetic or substitute ingredients ?
even if the entire beef industry were to gr@@ ind to a halt , the numerous heads of beef cattle worldwide would no longer be needed , but , being br@@ ed as they are , for beef , they would be useless for milk products .
not all beef can be infected , though , and the situation has become a waiting game .
for beef to be received or condemned , we are forced to turn to the scientists to establish whether or not B@@ SE and C@@ J@@ D are linked , and , more importantly , whether the latter can be contracted by eating meat contaminated with the former .
the nation awaits the verdict on ten@@ ter@@ hoo@@ ks , and it is in the majority &apos;s interests that there be no proven link .
watch this space .
personally , I believe that it is merely that man is better at diag@@ n@@ osing C@@ J@@ D now than ever before .
some reports say that it can take up to 20 years to develop , so we could all already have it .
whatever you believe , I shall continue to enjoy my roast beef and Yor@@ k@@ shire pudding , thank you .
there has been a big scare in Britain recently that some beef may contain B@@ SE ( bo@@ vine spon@@ gi@@ form ence@@ phal@@ opath@@ y ) which may lead to the human equivalent of C@@ J@@ D ( Cre@@ ut@@ z@@ f@@ eld@@ ts - Jacob disease ) .
B@@ SE is a disease in cows that effects their brain and spiral tissue ( or off@@ al as it is sometimes known ) .
after a few reported cases of C@@ J@@ D , a similar form of the disease found in humans , it is know thought that &apos; mad - cow disease &apos; ( B@@ SE ) is the cause .
researchers believe that eating beef containing off@@ al will transmit the fatal disease to humans .
this claim has devastated the British beef industry as people are now too scared to eat beef in case they contract the illness .
already the sales of beef in America have dropped by about 15 % and in Britain they have dropped about 6 % - 7 % .
although scientists say that to contract C@@ J@@ D part of the cows off@@ al must be contained within the beef .
customers are still reluctant to eat the meat in case it has come from some &apos; do@@ d@@ gy &apos; but@@ cher trying to cut costs .
as you can imagine this has had a tremendous influence on sales in places such as fast food restaurants where burgers are the main item on the menu .
an example of one is Mac@@ Donalds where they have immediately brought out a notice stating that their burgers are made from 100% of the finest , pure beef and contain no off@@ al .
in my views no half decent restaurant with a good reputation would risk buying poor beef in case a customer caught C@@ J@@ D and they managed to trace it back to the restaurant .
an outcome like this would mean they would be sued for several thousands of pounds and would probably have to sell up .
as a result of a lower beef demand in places of food production there would be a lower need for beef cows .
this means that there would be an excess of beef ( or a beef mountain ) that could not be sold .
because of this the prices of beef would have to decrease in order to attract more customers .
so , as a result of the claim that beef containing contaminated off@@ al may cause C@@ J@@ D in humans , farmers ( in particular beef farmers ) are losing out as they will have to sell their meat for a lower price due to the low demand .
as a result they may have to diversi@@ fy towards other areas such as crops , mil@@ king cows , etc . or even have to get a government subsidy .
I feel that the evidence that B@@ SE causes C@@ J@@ D was not strong enough before the claims were released .
it has therefore caused an unnecessary , dele@@ ter@@ ious effect on the agricultural industry and beef market .
the question of compensation for services rendered is never so simple as rem@@ itting a pre@@ determined salary based on qualifications and a person &apos;s dedication to the task at hand .
if one has pre@@ conceived no@@ tions concerning one &apos;s salary , one will certainly be disappointed since some employers are sure to value their skills and abilities less than others . &quot;
contribution to society &quot; is subjective and therefore impossible to compensate &quot; equally &apos; .
in the 19@@ 20s in American , it became very popular to dis@@ d@@ ain people who did not actually work for a living , but merely lived off the interest of their investments .
the stock market was experiencing a boom , and several formerly working - class citizens became wealthy and reli@@ shed the idea of retiring early .
but several great authors of that period questioned the right of these investors to effectively live as paras@@ ites ; they received money , but they contributed nearly nothing to society .
people who inherit money or live off the interest of investors often seem to spend their time in search of a new thrill , some sort of excitement that money can not buy .
having almost unlimited wealth changes people , both those who are born into wealth and those who earn their own money early on .
but do they have the right to live this way ?
what about people who work very hard yet they seem to be paid miser@@ ably .
a migrant work may slave away in a field all day long and make less money in a day than a wealthy person spends on a tip at lunch .
the answer this question lies in one &apos;s feelings about Demo@@ crac@@ ry .
some would argue that if a person is smart enough or lucky enough to earn money for an early retirement ( or for their children &apos;s inheritance ) he or she is entitled to it .
a rather hard view would be that if someone who works on a men@@ ial or physically ta@@ xing job does not make a fair or moderate salary then it is his or her own fault ( or bad luck ) .
these opinions are based on a rather faulty American premise that all people are given an equal chance in life and what they make of it is their own responsibly .
apparently , most people believe that they are under@@ paid and that others are over@@ paid .
for instance , everyone seems to think that doctors make much too money for the work they do , yet none of the doctors are lowering their fees ( they must think that it &apos;s a fair price ) .
so , unless we wish to impose on the personal lives of wealthy people by making them work harder , or give people who are not wealthy money that society does not believe they deserve , we can not give pay equal to contribution to society .
I agree that in the past women have had problems with societies role of what they are expected to do in the work place and at home .
women have been looked down on if they try to get ahead and pay has differ@@ ed with the same job for a man vers@@ es a woman doing the same job .
gone is the age that the woman is required to stay home .
now a lot of women work and the ones that want to stay home do it because they want to .
a lot of what has changed women &apos;s roles is the fe@@ mini@@ sts .
these are groups of people that have defended women over the years .
these people have shown the modern world what women in the work place can do .
the problem is that these fe@@ mini@@ sts have not looked at all women .
some women were happy with old traditions , some wanted a bit more in their lives , some wanted a lot more in their lives .
what happens is that all women have to go along with these fe@@ mini@@ sts rules .
this makes it hard , because if they do n&apos;t , they are looked down upon by their pi@@ ers .
an example is military women wanting to serve in combat positions when at war .
fe@@ mini@@ sts argued this a lot when the Iraq war was going on .
they felt that women should have been given the chance to fight .
I felt that these people were crazy .
women just ca n&apos;t fight in a war very well .
the are not strong enough and if captured could be raped .
they feel that it is not fair that men are the only ones .
other women , though , are glad that the rule in the United States stands as it does .
fe@@ mini@@ sts have talked about promotions in the work place as not being fair .
also sexual harassment is involved in a lot of suits .
many women believe that they are the victims .
I agree that five to ten years ago this might have been true , but now many employers are the victims .
they are scared of what a woman can do and sometimes women get looked at differently .
there are some things that women can do better than men and there are some things that men can do better than women .
God would have created us all the same if this was not true .
fe@@ mini@@ sts are trying to make everyone equal and that is impossible to do because nature can not be changed .
more and more office jobs are being filled by the woman but a lot of the physical jobs are still filled by men .
I think that the traditional roles were a good thing , but the modernization has changed everyone &apos;s habits .
divorce is at fifty percent and rising , women are having more heart attacks , being more stressful , and kids are being more neglected .
modernization is good , but I think that women should not be pressured into this if this is not for them .
there will be a woman in the presi@@ dency , and running a lot more companies .
women should be created equal , but they can only do what nature intended they to do ...
whenever a movement is began whether it be political , religious , or artistic , stereotypes are quick to form .
people normally associated with politics , religion , or art are quickly lum@@ ped into categories regardless of individual differences .
this tragedy is worsened by the tendency of those outside the movement to remember the radical and ignore the common or ordinary .
this is especially true of the Women &apos;s Liber@@ ation Mo@@ vement in America .
since its begin@@ nings in the late nineteenth century , Women &apos;s Liber@@ ation has been met with ad@@ am@@ ant , and often obst@@ inate opposition .
some of the first ra@@ dic@@ als , Susan B. Anthony and George S@@ and ( although French ) were noticed and ridicul@@ ed , thus defe@@ ating their cause , because of their aggressive action .
at the same time other fe@@ mini@@ sts such as Emily Dic@@ kinson were virtually ignored during their lifetime and only acknowledged pos@@ thum@@ ously as being part of the movement .
this ignorance of other less aggressive fe@@ mini@@ sts , made it seem as though the fe@@ mini@@ st movement was headed only by wild , dis@@ gr@@ un@@ tled zeal@@ ots and was therefore , detrimental to the good of society .
although &quot; ra@@ dic@@ als &quot; such as S@@ and and Anthony seem do@@ ci@@ le and backward in modern standards , the problem still exists .
from the very beginning the Women &apos;s Mo@@ vement in America has been fighting a losing battle .
however , I contend that the fault does not lie with the radical members of the movement , but rather , in the perception of those observing the movement .
when Women &apos;s li@@ b really took off again in the late 1960s , it was again destined for failure .
immediately , the focus was on ra@@ dic@@ als like Ste@@ in , instead of the housewife who returned to college and made a career for herself .
those outside the movement could only see the differences between &quot; norm@@ ality &quot; and Women &apos;s li@@ b .
this is still true twenty - five years later .
women supporting equal pay for women and and other &quot; liberal &quot; causes like affir@@ mative action are only seen in the shadow of the bra - burning , anti - shaving leaders of the 1970s .
the good of their cause is under@@ mined by the perception of the ra@@ dic@@ als .
so what am I getting at ?
only that so - called fe@@ mini@@ sts have not in and of themselves harmed the Women &apos;s movement .
however , the popular perception of them has .
for so many years the good that fe@@ mini@@ sts have promote for women has fallen by the way@@ side in li@@ eu of other more interesting , i.e. radical ideas .
like many other aspects and movements in life , they would be more readily received if the public it was being aimed was not so j@@ aded .
within this century there have been many technological advances which have resulted in a drastically different society than that of a hundred years ago .
clearly , of the inventions of this century , the one that has made the most impact on world views and lifestyle is the television .
this instrument has brought other worlds right into the living room , making it possible to see life in other countries in a way that was never before possible .
however , the invention of television also gave society an easy way to waste time ; one has only to turn it on to tune out reality .
television has potential to offer wonderful things to its viewers , such as educational programming for children , cultural programs about far away places , and a closer look at current events than can not be given by newspaper .
television has the power to bring war into the home as well as artistic expressions of those involved in the program production , giving society the opportunity to understand their own culture more fully .
however , this is not the way in which television has influenced society .
on the contrary , television has become the escape route of the masses , a way for people to flee from the conflicts they experience in their culture , rather than confront them and try to understand them .
in the minds of most Americans , television is regarded as a diversion rather than an educational tool , as free entertainment instead of easily accessible knowledge .
millions of Americans can be found to be staring at the T.@@ V. at any one time , watching sit - com@@ bs , soap - operas , and cartoons .
the T.@@ V. has become the center of many households ; in many families , the only time that everyone is together is when they are watching television .
t@@ .@@ v@@ . is a major cause of lack of toge@@ ther@@ ness found in many American families , and has also resulted in an increase in laziness .
the more time one spends watching TV , the less motivated he becomes ; there is no need to seek worthwhile activities when it is much easier to sit on the couch , pick up the remote control , and stare at a box .
television , therefore , has changed society in ways that could hardly have been dreamed of 00 years ago .
it has given society another creative ve@@ in , a look at worlds which could be seen in no other way , and an opportunity to better educate itself .
however , throughout the years , television has lost much of its integrity ; the programs offered are usually cheap entertainment rather than education .
the entertainment aspect of television has offered society an easy escape from its problems and difficulties .
therefore , since the invention of television , society has become more informed but too lazy to think about this new information , and has dist@@ anced itself from family life .
a discovery that has significantly changed many peoples lives and their ways of thinking is the epidemic , known as AIDS .
though it has probably been around for awhile , it &apos;s presence has n&apos;t really been known until fairly recently , and it &apos;s consequences have been devastating .
aids has definitely had an impact on people in the United States and probably all over the world because it always leads to death and there is no cure .
it has caused a lot of prejudice and par@@ ano@@ ia among people which has torn them apart .
for example , there is more of stig@@ ma attached to being a homosexual male , not only because of their sexual preference , but they probably have AIDS too .
this kind of ignorant thinking is breaking us apart .
also , when Ryan White , a boy who contracted AIDS through a blood transf@@ usion was diagnosed , the people of his town and his school treated him like a complete out@@ cast and would n&apos;t allow him to attend school .
with new discoveries of AIDS , par@@ ano@@ ia is at an all time high .
doctors are discovering that some un@@ detec@@ table str@@ ands of AIDS do exist .
this has really scared people because they may have AIDS and not even know it .
I feel this has really made people think about their actions .
in the early eigh@@ ties &quot; casual sex &quot; in the United States was a widely accepted idea , now it is something people really take into consideration and rarely occurs .
relationships seemed to be valued more than one night stands .
people are starting to realize that they really do have to be careful , and with more education on this disease , I &apos;m sure more changes will come about .
the twentieth century has seen more wars than any other previous Blo@@ c of time .
though advances in communication , transportation , and information sharing , the world as a body of people living in close proximity , has rapidly sh@@ runk .
in the second of the world wars , the race was on to create the most devastating , most powerful , and most frightening weapon our people had ever known .
in my opinion , the discovery and harness of atom and its energy and the corresponding invention of nuclear weapons have been the most significant factors of change in our lifetime , if not , perhaps , in several life@@ times .
as missile technology and nuclear fusion capacities increased and improved , fear began to replace nation@@ alism , and our small world erected barriers between its members .
from my experience as an American , I can remember associ@@ ating communi@@ sm with nuclear threat , Soviet citizens with anti - Christ , and bomb shelters , secret cities for underground , and weapons or@@ biting our planet , with daily , normal life .
perhaps this increasingly common mentality is the worst effect of our nuclear , cold war age .
in a planet which desperately needs our focus on environmental and human@@ it@@ arian issues , my country has spent uncountable tri@@ lli@@ ons of dollars on nuclear weapons testing , improvement , and implementation .
as a common@@ place goal and testi@@ mon@@ ial landmark to 9 presidential administr@@ ations , the cold war has mani@@ fested its awesome power and control over nearly every fac@@ et of Americ@@ ana ; from survival kits and basement bomb shelters to an ever circul@@ ating chief Ex@@ ecu@@ tive command post from the air .
in just the past three years our family of nations has seen the di@@ sm@@ ant@@ ling of the Berlin Wall and hundreds of other smaller symbols of freedom , and an end to oppression in many circumstances .
with this , the walls , bar@@ bed wire , and mental barriers are falling , bringing more change than our planet has seen since its gen@@ esis .
although the old habits die hard , they are indeed dying .
in America the military has been reduced by several thousand troops , and the production of nuclear war@@ heads has virtually arrived a stand@@ still .
hopefully , with continued efforts , our use of nuclear fusion and fission will turn from medi@@ ums of strategy , destruction , and waste to matters of energy production , medicine , and other human@@ it@@ arian goals .
with this th@@ aw@@ ing of attitudes , our fri@@ gid planet and cold neighbors may once again be a warm and friendly people .
the discovery of penicillin as an antibiotic was one of the greatest advances in medicin@@ al chemistry .
as a natural antibiotic , penicillin was discovered to have many uses in stopping and preventing the spread of infections .
this &quot; wonder - drug &quot; also led to the discovery of a variety of other naturally - occurring antibiotics that could also be cul@@ tured &quot; in vit@@ ro &quot; in a laboratory .
this sudden burst of useful compounds not only improved the chances of a patient &apos;s survival in a hospital but also caused a great need for medical chemi@@ sts to study and classify each new drug as it was discovered .
as discoveries of new antibiotics decreased , chemi@@ sts began to wonder if certain variations of these drugs could be synthe@@ sized and also used as medicine .
it was also attempted to increase the production of the naturally - occurring antibiotics through syn@@ thesis .
both of these new attempts caused a need for more research , more companies , and more medical chemi@@ sts , and the industry increased tremendously .
it was discovered that the older drugs could be synthe@@ sized efficiently while still remaining bi@@ ologically active .
new drugs were also synthe@@ sized ; some were found to be medic@@ ally useful while others were not .
a variety of new drugs continuously appeared on the market and changed the way people thought about taking medicine .
it was now much easier to obtain antibiotics for simple illnesses , such as the common cold .
huge enterprises , such as Up@@ jo@@ hn , were formed and grew , and universities had research teams devoted to producing efficient syn@@ thesis routes for the production of all kinds of antibiotics .
the discovery of one compound led to the increase of health of millions of people , to the discovery of more and more antibiotics , and to a booming industry comprised of research teams and large companies .
the syn@@ thesis of antibiotics and research of their uses still continues today as thousands of universities and companies around the world continue the work of a small bacteria -- the producer of penicillin .
the modern micro@@ computer ( PC ) has evolved at an incredibly fast pace : from the very first modern computer in the 1940 &apos;s to the computers of today , there have been many technological advances and also there has been a tremendous impact on society .
the computer has eliminated many jobs through automation of factories ; accounting , engineering , and other scientific programs , etc .
the effects of the computer have been tremendous ; however , the phenomenon is a catch@@ -@@ 22 .
the computer has made life easier from a physical standpoint and harder from a mental standpoint .
the physical effects of the computer are numerous and easily seen .
in offices , the computer is everywhere .
from word process@@ ors to sp@@ read@@ sheet / database programs , computers have made office work easier and faster .
automation of factories has also eliminated many manual jobs .
also almost everyone has at least one simple computer , e.g. a calculator .
there are of course many other things computers are used for , but a leng@@ thy list is not necessary as everyone already knows ( except for people in 2nd and 3rd world countries ) how abundant computers are .
the mental effect of computers is two - fold .
firstly , computers have made mathematical compu@@ tations so easy to do , many people do not fully understand how or why their computer works .
this has created a surplus of &quot; needless &quot; compu@@ tations , figures , etc .
people can easily do calcul@@ us or other type functions with a computer .
what many people do not realize is that computers make errors all the time .
granted , it is the person who &quot; told &quot; the computer what to do that truly made the error ; however if that person knew what he should do , or better stated &quot; was able to do with a computer &quot; , he would not have err@@ one@@ ous answers .
mathematical models , theories , etc .
are absolutely ri@@ dd@@ led with errors simply because there are many things people do n&apos;t know or ca n&apos;t predict .
due to this errors frequently exist in the world of computers simply because humans are ignor@@ ant@@ - for whatever reason - of many &quot; variables &quot; .
secondly , computers have sometimes become more reliable than people .
a computer &apos;s circuits do n&apos;t get tired and , if programmed 100% correctly ( another perhaps impossible compu@@ tation ) , never make errors .
this supposed reliability has left many workers out of work .
the effects of this are unpredictable .
anger , frustration , fear , and many other negative feelings have sp@@ rung up simultaneously with the rise of computer usage .
clearly , there is evidence of good and bad results from the advent of the modern computer .
it would be practically impossible to throw the computer away or never use it again .
yet there are practical solutions .
better mathematical education is needed for everyone who uses a computer other than a simple calculator .
also , cur@@ ta@@ iling some theoretical programming could eliminate alarming predictions or err@@ one@@ ous results .
the key is probably in the classroom .
people should learn more about the ram@@ i@@ fications about what they are doing .
( this probably would require understanding of philosophy and psychology as well as mathematics and science . )
in either case , if computers are good or bad , it would be difficult to dispute their impact on people &apos;s lives .
a large , 1/2 egg , sometimes as large as a small Fi@@ at , with a metal arrow in it &apos;s center has changed the size of the world , and communication amongst the countries within it .
the satellite dish , created in the last 0 years , has changed the meaning of telecommunication .
in part , it has created The Information Age , as the latter part of the 20th try , is often la@@ bell@@ ed .
not certain about the date of its invention , it must be recognized as one of the more vital tools used in society today , amongst world leaders , trading companies , and the media , as well as the entertainment world .
TED Tur@@ ner revolution@@ ized the use of the satellite , with his creation of CNN , the round - the - clock , round - the - world news station .
presidents and dict@@ ators alike switch the channel to receive first hand information from the network , such as impe@@ ach@@ ment , coup d&apos;@@ et@@ ats or civil wars .
decisions , of governmental autonomy , are being made , based on that nights news CNN comment@@ ator .
the leaders and presidents of enterprises such as pan@@ asonic and COR@@ E refer to CNN , created by satellite dish , on a daily bases .
stocks are an integral part of their livelihood .
the entertainment world has taken full advantage of the satellite dish , sub@@ tit@@ ling the Information Age , with the MTV age .
the creation of MTV in 1980 , has dramatically changed the entertainment business .
the money poured into creating videos , and the profits from view@@ er@@ ship@@ - have had a strong affect on the world economy .
40% of U.S. milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res are entertainers .
the Sat@@ el@@ lite dish has also created distinct advantages for C@@ able TV and nav@@ al programs as well .
the intelligence of an average teenager is lowering itself due to cable viewing , created by the satellite dish .
nav@@ al programs have wasted exc@@ eeding amounts of money in the United States , due to the satellite dish .
and one must not forget space programs such a Star@@ wars .
the creation of the satellite dish in the past 20 years , has altered the average intelligence of the human being for the better and sometimes worse .
it has created an information age , which could be dangerous , and he@@ igh@@ tened an entertainer &apos;s salary .
the pro &apos;s and con &apos;s of the satellite dish are numerous .
the only observation which can be made , is that : it has altered people lives significantly .
it is up to the average person to decide if this alter@@ ation will be for the better or worse .
the discovery of the Atomic energy , is undoubtedly the the most awesome as well as terrible invention not only of the 20th century but of all time .
in 1945 , J. Robert Op@@ pen@@ heim@@ er un@@ ve@@ iled to the world his invention in the form that is still most familiar to us today : the Atomic bomb .
the reason behind the fear that this energy causes is rou@@ ted in its incredible power to destroy .
never before had the world seen something with such a capacity to kill .
never before had one object of such small size been able to take so many lives .
for this reason , It is considered the most awe - inspiring and dangerous weapon in the world .
unfortunately , with each progressive day , the world &apos;s need for this dangerous energy au@@ gments .
for not only does it have the capacity to kill ,
but also the capability to supply and energi@@ ze the world .
the drawback is the danger .
in utilizing this power in plants and factories we run the risk of contaminating our land , blowing holes in our sky , ren@@ dering our seas useless , and killing our species as well as all the species of the earth .
although we have many other power source alternatives , we still continue to use this dangerous invention .
it is illogical to think that with continued nuclear use , we can escape harm .
already as a result of pollution and other various factors , we have holes in our ozone layer and problems with our soil in many parts of the world .
it would be logical to think that the leaders of the world would conf@@ er and aspire to put a stop to nuclear use in an effort to avoid any further damage to the earth and its inhabitants .
the saddest part of this tragedy is that there have been very few efforts to do so .
the lack of sight from our leaders is almost app@@ alling .
with the lack of respect for the planet that is the general attitude of today , what is to become of our children .
the current situation of the world &apos;s environment is a sad one .
it is also however , a problem of which nuclear energy is only a small piece .
unfortunately , the day will soon come when the damage caused by this ap@@ athy will be irre@@ voc@@ able .
this is why it is imperative to act today .
it starts with you .
write your local con@@ gres@@ sman .
an invention of the 20th century which I think has significantly changed people &apos;s lives is the invention of the airplane .
the extend to which this invention has altered people &apos;s lives is astronom@@ ical .
the airplane opened doors to traveling and also broad@@ ened people &apos;s perceptions of the entire world .
it also introduced what seemed a completely impossible concept which no human is capable of doing without a machine : the concept of flying .
before the invention of the airplane , long distance traveling was a very difficult , time consuming task .
for this reason people did not travel extremely long distances and missed the opportunity of visiting countries with cultures very different from their own .
one could travel by boat but this was inconvenient and often dangerous because of various things like disease , hunger , and threatening weather ; also as noted above , it was extremely time consuming .
because of the lack of long distance travel people often had a very eth@@ no@@ centric and limited concept of the world .
I have learned a lot about my own culture just from being in Spain and that is the only foreign country I have ever visited .
I can admit that before I came to Spain I was very ignorant about other cultures .
even though I would watch the news and read about other cultures I still did not have the opportunity to witness it first hand .
the invention of the airplane has opened many doors and one other door is international relations .
since the invention of the airplane the world has increased close contact between political systems , and international business endeav@@ ors .
the frequency that which foreign countries are able to communicate and negotiate face to face has improved drastically the establishment of international trade .
the airplane has also basically spee@@ ded up the whole postal communication system also .
life with airplanes is more rapid paced .
cars , telephones , and nuclear energy are just three examples of inventions and discoveries that have had profound effects on modern day life .
we must remember , however , that the field of technology is not the only one in which significant advances have been made in the 0@@ th century .
another &quot; discovery &quot; of this past century has been femin@@ ism , which has had a significant impact on the lives of both men and women .
of course , the issue of femin@@ ism is not a new one , but it is just within the past century that much progress has been made towards the equality of women ( with the important exception of women winning the right to vote in the 18@@ 00s ) .
as recently as the 1950s , it was still the most typical as well as the ideal to have the woman in the home , housekeeping and tending the children .
the first significant equal rights movement in the U.S. was in the 7@@ 0s with the Equ@@ al Rights A@@ mend@@ ment , which failed .
even today , the woman is still only earning something like 60 cents for every dollar that a man earns .
femin@@ ism does not only have to do with work and money , but also with the image of women .
it &apos;s only recently that we &apos;ve &quot; discovered &quot; , or begun to think about rather , how much things as varying as porno@@ graphy or the language we use helps to form the image of women .
a recognition of such influences on the image of women is the first step in breaking it down , so that women are seen for who they truly are .
femin@@ ism is better described as a &quot; discovery in progress &quot; ; it &apos;s a movement , an attitude that has not yet become mainstream .
only when women have achieved equality with men , will there cease to be a need for femin@@ ism , and the discovery will have been completed .
the idea I feel that has most significantly changed people &apos;s lives in the 20th century is that of caring for the environment .
today , people have become aware of the importance of environment to our future .
people are concerned with nuclear weapons .
we realize that countries that which have many weapons have the power to destroy the world .
also related to this topic is nuclear waste .
nuclear waste is not only harmful to humans ; it also kills animals and plants .
we are now fighting for acts to clean up our lakes and rivers .
companies are no longer able to freely dump their wastes w / o being heavily fined .
people have also become concerned with nature .
we used to assume our natural resources were never ending .
now , though , we realize what we use , needs to be replaced .
for example deforestation is a very big issue , many groups have formed to plant more trees .
we also realize our fossil fuels need to be used more conserv@@ atively .
another important topic we are all aware of is recycling .
this links 2 issues , one of not producing much biodegradable products and the other of re@@ using what we have .
( recycling in a small way also helps those w / o homes b / c they receive money for their collections ) .
many countries realize that recycling is not only beneficial to their economy it also is beneficial to their environment .
another important issue is that of conserving energy .
in the past , once again , we assumed our energy was never ending .
now though people are more inclined to turn off their lights when they &apos;re not in their rooms , to not leave taps running and basically not to waste our natural resources .
we realize that conserving is not beneficial to our environment but it is also saves money .
we have also become more considerable of our animal life .
we are no longer able to kill animals freely .
we do still raise some for food but hunting is limited and we are all aware of the possibilities of extinction .
one realizes that animals have rights too .
in conclusion , the idea of caring for the environment is still a new one .
we are slowly becoming more aware and are beginning to take more precautions .
the ideas above are just a few of the topics we are now concerned with .
but we are heading in the right direction and hopeful by the 21st century we will have fixed everything we have destroyed !
computers have definitely effected peoples lives .
I have a computer and my life has change because of it .
I &apos;m able to store almost all the information I need for school and for other things in my computer whereas before I had a computer my desk was cl@@ uttered w@@ / paper and records of all sorts , I no longer need to keep these records but only to transfer them to my computer .
this means I &apos;m able to store more information in an organized fashion .
though I have only used a fraction of my computer &apos;s ability , I &apos;m still aware of the tremendous opportunities which I have or will have .
aside from being able to store great amounts of info , I &apos;m also able to process and to edit things quickly .
for example , without the use of a computer I had to balance my check@@ book once a month and had to this w@@ / a calculator , a pen and a piece of paper .
of course , this was very time consuming and open to error . W@@ / the use of a computer I have programmed the computer to make the calculations which I once had to make .
also , w@@ / the use of the Word Process@@ or I &apos;m able to edit and rearrange documents w / out altering the entire document , and furthermore , though I have yet to use the Communic@@ ations program in my computer , this program seems to be extraordinarily helpful .
my father has the same program in his computer and is able to buy on line tickets w / out leaving the house and moreover w / out picking up the phone .
also , I realize that my experience w@@ / computers is limited and that the power of computers , for me , is incomprehensible .
I &apos;m now here in Madrid .
how did I get there ?
well , I applied to the this program , was accepted , and flew here form the US .
but , w / out the use of computers I would still be struggling w@@ / the secretary in the International Program@@ s Office at Boston University , no doubt .
instead , once I applied to the program@@ - the application for which was probably computer gener@@ ated@@ - I assume my info was processed by a computer .
w / out this luxury , the International Program@@ s Office would inevitably in@@ un@@ dated w@@ / paperwork and things would therefore be lost or at least mis@@ placed .
when booking my flight , though I did not do this myself , the transaction would seem impossible minus the aid of computers .
computers have had a most significant impact on the people in the latter 1/2 of the 20th century .
an invention of the 20th century that I think has significantly changed people &apos;s lives is television .
TV allows the instantaneous communication of ideas , images , news , etc .
now , if something is happening in any part of the world@@ - from across town all the way to Beijing -- every person in the world can watch this event as it is happening .
while previously people had to wait days , or even weeks for news ( which consisted of second - or third - hand accounts , which always involved much interpretation and distor@@ tion ) now they can see it happening , for themselves , as it is happening , this allows them to make their own , informed judgment about the event ; and if a reaction is necess@@ ary@@ - such as the gathering of opposition to a certain law -- it can be made immediately , while the emotions are still strong , and before the action is fin@@ alized .
as well , the fact that so many people ( especially in the US ) have television sets means that everybody ( well , at least everybody who watches ) receives the same in@@ flow of information and ideas .
so , for example , people in Spain can be informed about how people in California or Japan speak and act , this allows people from different cultures to come together and discuss ideas .
in my opinion , this is one part of the process of making the world a &quot; smaller &quot; , more unified place , or a &quot; global village &quot; as one journalist has called this world of the Information Age .
not only the news , but also entertainment is an important practical function of television , through television entertainment , as through literature and drama , people learn different messages about life .
they can see various actions acted out to their ends , and understand the consequences of these actions , without having to perform the same actions and experience the consequences for themselves .
unfortunately these TV shows are not always accurate portr@@ ay@@ als of real life and have a tendency to glori@@ fy violence , as well as making life seem the good guy always wins , and always lives thr@@ u dangerous situations .
however , this sense of reality is not so distorted , and so hidden that people are going around acting like Superman .
as long as one has a well - developed sense of reality , TV can be an excellent tool for understanding the world we live in .
the waters of the culinary seas have been calm and consistent for centuries .
progress has move slow like the ti@@ des and the constant rhythm of the waves have showed little changed .
however with the day@@ break of the twentieth century a storm has bre@@ wed .
with this storm the waters have chur@@ ned and sp@@ aw@@ ned a wave that has crashed upon the rocks of every kitchen .
this wave is the microwave .
never before has such an invention revolution@@ ized a science like this .
a complete break has been for@@ ged in the way food is prepared .
at the dawn of time , cave men cooked animal flesh over open fires .
as History progressed , sp@@ its and ar@@ a@@ be@@ squ@@ es emerged .
technology saw the advent of the wood stove , and later ones fu@@ eled by coal .
modern times saw gas and electric ranges as to st@@ aple .
all these things had one thing in common : fire .
flame , the source of life , always used to prepare the fool of mankind throughout History .
however , the microwave uses radiation to excite water particles in food , thus creating fri@@ ction , which creates heat .
this is a prime example of thinking that does not follow in old footsteps but breaks away from convention and for@@ ges new routes .
if this were not amazing enough , the microwave cuts cooking time in half .
if you had told someone 100 yrs ago that you could cut cooking time in half , and not use fire , they would have thought you crazy , or be@@ wit@@ ched , or under the influence of heavy drugs .
in an age where time is the scarce commodity , our society has embraced this elimin@@ at or of wasted hours in the kitchen .
a mother who works , can come home can whip up something in minutes in the microwave , whereas before she would have been sl@@ aving in the kitchen .
the microwave is excellent for re - heating making it easier for people to make excess food to be eaten later .
again time is conserved -- Children are able to use this simple device without parental fear of fires starting .
for As I have said before , there is no fire !
this mar@@ vel of technology has helped prop@@ el people into the dizz@@ ying pace of life that most of us lead in the 20th century .
throughout History one can see that great revel@@ ations in all areas come from breaks in tradition , new insights , and different perspectives .
all these were needed to create the microwave which is essential nowadays .
eating is something everyone must do .
this device has sp@@ ed up one of our most important activities and thus revolution@@ ized life in the fast paced 20th century .
when I was in tenth grade a teacher said that the 2 most important inventions that made possible the idea of a re@@ pressive government were the machine gun and the radio .
a machine gun can be used to keep civil peace , enforce Mar@@ shall Law .
the radio can be used to communicate ideas and under a dictat@@ orship , propaganda .
in the 20th Century the machine gun has not changed all that many lives ( except for those that it &apos; s killed ) , but the invention of radio has made a tremendous impact .
the idea behind the radio is simple .
there is one transm@@ itter and it sends its signals through the air , waves , with potential for millions of recei@@ vers .
in the 20th Century radio has become a source of information and entertainment .
radio keeps people informed .
I don &apos; t think any people of my generation can even comprehend now our lives would be different .
every morning I listen for the weather forecast and dress accordingly .
at night one can sit by the radio and hear how the events of the day un@@ folded .
radio , hence , gives people the option of becoming passive ob@@ servers rather than active participants in the news making process .
newspapers had been around for many years but it was not until the invention of radio that the power of the media became evident .
radio gives the ability to reach many more people , instantly .
as a form of entertainment , radio and its most important and now more common off@@ shoot , television , has changed people &apos;s lives .
a typical day for a child in today &apos;s world , consists of going to school and coming home to watch T.@@ V.
there have even been forms of entertainment , for example videogames , made for this other form of entertainment .
nowadays everybody watches T.@@ V.
my se@@ ñ@@ ora , for example , is over 100 years old , and for her T.@@ V. is the greatest thing in the world .
she sits in front of it all day and it keeps her happy .
television offers soap operas , game shows , sit - com@@ bs , sporting events , movies and much more to keep us entertained 24 hours a day .
in short , I don &apos; t know what life was like before radio , but its invention has changed the way we see and do things .
a current ideology in the United States today is for one to be successful , one must follow all of the written and unwritten rules of society ,
everyone has an equal opportunity to succeed and when one does not do this one fails .
one can see these ideas in popular media everyday .
t@@ .@@ v@@ . Commer@@ ci@@ als and T.@@ V. programs project models of how one should be .
in the 20th cent , the values of / that the United States was founded on have changed in meaning and sense when applied to modern day America , nothing was ever equal .
and today , since the invention and utilization of modern technologies such as computers life for Americans moves at a much faster pace .
people are more mobile , can work more , and buy more things , but time for relaxation and family are often substitu@@ ted with T.@@ V. In America , this growing individualistic society , one no longer sees the reactive human ness between people , instead one sees the differences , the unlucky , the unsuccessful , and attribu@@ te their in@@ adequ@@ acy to achieve to a lack of effort .
with everyone moving at such a fast pace , the gaps are easy to miss , the voices of the mass media easily replace those voices that struggle to be heard .
the parts of the new machine that need o@@ iled and regulated .
when Vol@@ ta@@ ire wrote Candi@@ de , a literary style known as Ne@@ o@@ class@@ ic@@ ism was at its peak .
there was a group of scholars in France , l@@ &apos;@@ Aca@@ de@@ mi@@ e fran@@ ç@@ ais , that set guidelines for French literature .
according to l@@ &apos;@@ Aca@@ de@@ mi@@ e fran@@ ç@@ ais , all literature of the Ne@@ o@@ classic period must follow the rules of prop@@ ri@@ ety which regulated the author should avoid certain topics , including sex , violence , church , and state issues .
another standard up@@ held by the Aca@@ de@@ mi@@ e is the idea of veri@@ si@@ milit@@ ude , making literature as realistic as possible by keeping the time , setting and plot true to life .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire , as a Ne@@ o@@ class@@ ici@@ st , knew all these regulations and followed them in his literature .
however , when writing Candi@@ de , Vol@@ ta@@ ire de@@ fied the Aca@@ de@@ mi@@ e &apos;s rules .
Candi@@ de is a parody on the guidelines of Ne@@ o@@ class@@ ic@@ ism .
Ne@@ o@@ class@@ ici@@ sts liked for literature to have good manners : they did not want to step on anyone &apos;s toes by mentioning sex , violence , church , or state issues .
in Candi@@ de Vol@@ ta@@ ire did not seem to mind stepping on toes - in fact , he did not mind sma@@ shing feet !
Vol@@ ta@@ ire went beyond the comfort level when he mentioned sex .
he told of the two girls of O@@ rel@@ lion who were lovers of monkeys , and of the Bar@@ on who bath@@ ed with the Mus@@ sel@@ man and was punished for his homosexual act .
sex turned into violence when Cun@@ eg@@ on@@ de was being raped by a Bar@@ ber , and witnessed his murder while he was on top of her .
the wise old woman underwent the removal of a but@@ to@@ ck by pirates , as well as experiencing rape .
after the Bar@@ on is caught bathing with the Mus@@ sal@@ man , he receives 100 la@@ shes for his sin .
Candi@@ de st@@ abs the Bar@@ on , a Jes@@ u@@ it Pri@@ est , after the Bar@@ on forbi@@ ds Candi@@ des marriage to Cun@@ eg@@ on@@ de .
ironically , although Vol@@ ta@@ ire mentions many acts of violence , each act is treated lightly : Cun@@ eg@@ on@@ de and the old woman both tell their tales of being de@@ filed like an entertaining story in their conversations about their travels ; the Bar@@ on also continues his tale with style after telling of his beating ; and after Candi@@ de &quot; kills &quot; the Bar@@ on , he leaves to search for Cun@@ eg@@ on@@ de with no second thought until he encounters the Bar@@ on later in his travels .
the light attitude in which these acts of sex and violence are written shows the parody form in which Vol@@ ta@@ ire writes Candi@@ de .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire chooses not to stay away from the church and state issues .
he attracts the hip@@ po@@ cracy of the Church in the old woman &apos;s father being the Pope .
when Candi@@ de visits the land of E@@ ld@@ or@@ ado , Vol@@ ta@@ ire shows the people &apos;s perfect relationship to God : they only praise God because there is nothing they want from God .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire uses this perfect relationship to God in an unrealistic situation to f@@ oil society &apos;s imperfect relationship with God in the real world .
Vol@@ ta@@ ire makes fun of aristoc@@ rac@@ y in his description of the Bar@@ on , who came from 71 generations of nobility but still lacks gent@@ leness .
Candi@@ de and his companions dine with 6 de@@ thr@@ oned kings who represent the importance society places on hier@@ archy .
in his portr@@ ayal of the ut@@ opian society of E@@ ld@@ or@@ ado , Vol@@ ta@@ ire to@@ ils the im@@ perfec@@ tions of our society .
according the Lun@@ de , 35% of hom@@ icide victims are killed by someone they know .
statistics from 56 are greater than Lun@@ des &apos; thesis .
frustration is the main factor most impli@@ cated in these tragedies .
most cases are those of the &quot; trigger pulling the finger &quot; .
today , racial prejudice still exists , but less action has taken place than 30 years ago .
thirty years ago , minorities could n&apos;t ride a bus , vote , or go to school with white people .
Des@@ e@@ gr@@ ag@@ ation reduced some prejudice , but it still exists .
the difference is , today social prejudice is not openly expressed as it was 30 years ago .
I would tell the client to be extremely nice to that person and do favors for that person .
that person would then feel obligated to do nice things back and return favors .
this is based on e@@ au@@ ity theory .
it would be better for the client to do nice things for the person that it would be to ask a favor of the person .
someone who live in the north who comes to live in the south may not be prejudice toward Bl@@ acks at first .
after living in the south for a while , they may adopt southern attitudes toward Bl@@ acks and feel prejudice toward them .
this is con@@ form@@ ity .
the same goes for Sou@@ ther@@ ners who move north .
they come to feel prejudice toward Jews .
I know someone who has lived all over the world .
he is prejudice toward Jews , Bl@@ acks , and Mexic@@ ans .
he adopted white attitudes against minorities in the different regions he has lived in .
our country has been co@@ ined a &quot; melting - pot &quot; in@@ fer@@ ring that we all come from different that we all come from different background but have joined or melted together to produce hom@@ og@@ ene@@ ous Americans .
but a persons heritage , as we are realizing , is important to their sense of self and community .
ethnic American cultures have been revi@@ ving and trying to re@@ establish roots that were once l@@ opped off to a model U.S. citizen .
the differences they are re@@ discovering only add more color , flavor and excitement to that brewing &quot; pot &quot; of our people .
however , some individuals and even groups of Americans are reacting negatively to this ethnic explosion ( seen most clearly through the arts ) .
they do n&apos;t want to accept these differences .
they choose to remain indifferent to the pli@@ ghts of their fellow Americans .
as Ellie Wei@@ sel , author of such books as Night says about in@@ difference : it is the opposite of everything good .
the opposite of love , beauty , intelligence , light , joy , life and growth are not their familiar syn@@ onyms but in@@ difference .
ethnic American literature tries to fight this in@@ difference by vividly and uniqu@@ ely expressing certain aspects of different American culture .
the gam@@ ut of ethnic American literature is without b@@ ounds .
each group has its own pecu@@ li@@ arities and attributes that make it &apos;s writing unique .
in many cases the words used in ethnic American literature reflect a knowledge of a different &quot; mother tongue &quot; .
for instance , Native Americans poetry is more expressive and visual partly because their language is deeply rooted in the observation of the natural environment .
Chinese American Literature is philosophical / liter@@ al because their native language is so .
African American literature is often mel@@ odi@@ ous and rhyth@@ mic mir@@ r@@ oring their similar achievements in Jaz@@ zy and Bl@@ ues music .
all these examples ( and more ) give us some insight to other cultures we would otherwise never know .
the stories told in this genre of literature , however , are likely the most important aspect of Eth@@ nic American literature .
it is through the experiences of the characters that we learn about the different cultures in the United States .
when we learn of the trials and hardships that they went through we can sympathize with their emotions and try to accept that diversity .
the stories of black American slaves and of concentration camp victims are necessary to avoid in@@ difference .
without learning about the past ( and present ) horrors there is no way to ensure future humanity .
ethnic American literature benefits U.S. citizens in many ways .
it opens our eyes to the reality of the suffering of others .
it gives us a fresh and new perspective on the world around us .
